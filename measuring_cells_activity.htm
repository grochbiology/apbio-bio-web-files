<p>Procedure:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Look through the microscope using low power magnification. The
circle of light you see is called the field of view. It has the diameter of
about 4 mm. If you convert millimeters (mm) to micrometers (µm), the diameter
of the field view equals 4000 µm. </p>
<p>2. Look through the microscope using high power magnification. The field of
view is now about 0.3 mm (300 um) in diameter.</p>
<p>3. Convert the following measurements.</p>
<p>a) 1.5 mm = ____ µm&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) 400 µm =
____ mm</p>
<p>4. To estimate the size of a cell while looking through the microscope,
follow this method.</p>
<p>a) locate the cell under low power and then under high power.</p>
<p>b) draw a circle that represents your field of view. Draw the cell <u>to
scale</u> (same size as it appears) within the circle.</p>
<p>c) estimate the number of same-sized cells that could fit end-to-end or
side-by-side across the diameter of the circle.</p>
<p>d) to determine cell size on low power, divide 1350 µm by the total number of
cells that would fit across the circle's diameter. The size of the original cell
will be that quotient. (Example if 3.5 cells fit across the diameter, then
1350/3.5 = 385 µm).</p>
<p>e) to determine the cell size on high power, divide 300 um by the number of 
cells lined up end-to-end or side-by-side . (Example 300/10 cells = 30 µm).</p>
<p>5. Examine the prepared slide of frog red blood cells. Determine if this
slide is best viewed under low or high power. Complete the data table (column
1).</p>
<p>6. Examine the prepared slide of Paramecium. Determine if this slide is best
viewed under low or high power. Complete the data table (column 2).</p>
<p>7. Prepare a wet mount of an Elodea leaf and observe it through the
microscope. Determine if this slide is best viewed under low or high power.
Complete the data table (column 3).</p>
<p>8. Prepare a wet mount of onion skin (not the brown part) the clear peel
between the sections and observe it through the microscope. Add a drop of
Lugol's to stain the onion darker. Determine if this slide is best viewed under
low or high power. Complete the data table (column 4).</p>
<p>Data Table (reproduce this table in your journal, make sure you leave enough
room for drawing cells).</p>

<p>Conclusion Questions</p>
<p>Directions: Refer to your results and your text for aid in answering each of
the following questions in your journal.</p>
<p>1. Convert each of the following cell measurements.</p>
<table border="1" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="33%">a) 0.25 mm = ___ µm</td>
    <td width="33%">b) 0.06 mm = ____ µm</td>
    <td width="34%">c) 10.7 µm = _____ mm</td>
  </tr>

<p>2. A student observed the same cell under low power and then under high
power. The number of cells that could fit across the field of view was estimated
at 10 on low power and 2.2 on high power. Determine the cell size under each
power.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Determine the cell length and cell width in each diagram.</p>
<p>a) low power</p>
<p><img border="0" src="image001.gif" width="169" height="169"></p>
<p>b) high power</p>
<p><img border="0" src="image001.gif" width="169" height="169"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. a) What structures are in the elodea cells that are missing in the onion? </p>
<p>b) Why do you think it was necessary to stain the onion specimen?</p>
<p>c) So approximately how many cells are in one elodea leaf?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This activity requires the use of hazardous components and/or 
has the potential for hazardous reactions. Please review the</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">Safety Precautions section on the following page and relevant 
Material Safety Data Sheets before beginning this activity.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Procedure:</p>
</b></font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">
<p ALIGN="LEFT">1. Wash the underside of a wrist that will be sampled for 
epidermal cells with soap and water.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">2. Stick a clean piece of clear tape on the underside of the 
washed wrist.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">3. Gently remove the piece of tape from the wrist being careful 
to avoid getting fingerprints on the tape. A forceps might help</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">to remove the tape and avoid fingerprinting the tape.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">4. Place the tape, sticky-side up, on a clean microscope slide.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">5. Stain the top, sticky side of the tape with 2 or 3 drops of 
1% methylene blue solution.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">6. Use a dissecting needle to gently place a cover slip over the 
sticky tape. Lower the coverslip down onto the tape and then</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">remove the dissecting needle. This should help prevent staining 
your fingers. </font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><i>Caution: Use 
methylene blue carefully. It</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">will stain most items including skin, clothing, and table tops.</p>
</i>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">7. Examine the slide under a microscope. Look for cells with low 
power first, and then switch to high power for details.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">8. Record your observations of epidermal cells by making 
drawings. Label your drawings with appropriate magnifications.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">Use your knowledge of the size of the microscopic field to 
estimate the size of the cells.</p>
</font><font FACE="Times New Roman"><b>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">Discussion:</p>
</b></font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">
<p ALIGN="LEFT">There has been concern expressed about the classic activity in 
which students remove cheek cells from the inside of their</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">mouths. The procedure described in this activity eliminates the 
potential dangers inherent in collecting cheek cells from the</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">mouth. The cells secured from the wrist will be easy to find. 
Students may have to examine numerous cells before they find a</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">“nice” cell with nucleus, etc. Patience will yield good results. 
Students are likely to be amazed at how easy it is to remove cells</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">from the surface of the skin. The simple removal technique 
illustrates the fact that the skin is continually shed. Microbes and other</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">organisms are shed along with the skin thus helping in the fight 
against microbe invasion.</p>
<font FACE="Times New Roman"><b>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">Safety Precautions:</p>
</b></font>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">Methylene blue is a vital stain, it stains nearly everything, 
and it is difficult to remove. Prevention is the key when working</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">with vital stains. Wear chemical splash goggles, 
chemical-resistant gloves, and a chemical-resistant apron.</p>
