<p class="MsoNormal"><b>'Spider-man' suit secret revealed </b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>A &quot;Spider-man&quot; suit that enables its wearer to scale 
vertical walls like the comic and movie superhero could one day be a reality, 
according to a study. </i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Natural technology used by spiders and geckos could help a 
human climb the side of a building or hang upside down from a roof, the analysis 
suggests. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The findings are published in the Journal of Physics: 
Condensed Matter. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Both spiders and geckos possess tiny &quot;hairs&quot; that allow 
them to stick to surfaces. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Some studies suggest that geckos can hold hundreds of times 
their own body weight. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In 2002, US research suggested this adhesion in geckos was 
due to very weak intermolecular forces. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">These are produced by billions of hair-like structures of 
different sizes that are arranged in a hierarchical structure on each gecko 
foot. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The intermolecular &quot;van der Waals&quot; forces arise when 
unbalanced electrical charges around molecules attract one another. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The cumulative attractive force of billions of gecko hairs 
allows the reptiles to scurry up walls and even hang upside down on polished 
glass. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Size effect </b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Professor Nicola Pugno, from the Polytechnic of Turin, 
Italy, has calculated how sufficient stickiness could be generated in the same 
way to support an adult human's body weight. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">But the bigger the surface that needs to stick, the lower 
its adhesion strength. So a glove able to fit a man's hand, and covered with 
artificial gecko hairs, should not be as sticky as a gecko's foot. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Luckily, the gecko only uses a fraction of the theoretical 
stickiness available through van der Waals forces. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&quot;Some researchers were able to measure a [theoretical] 
adhesion strength 200 times higher than the adhesion strength in the gecko. But 
between theory and practical applications there is a large gap,&quot; said Professor 
Pugno. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&quot;If we are able to make a surface a little bit stronger, so 
that the size effect vanishes, we might be able to make a suit with the same 
adhesion as a gecko.&quot; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Turin-based researcher proposes that carbon nanotubes 
could be used as an artificial alternative to the gecko's hairs. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Carbon nanotubes are tiny cylinders of carbon that measure 
just a few billionths of a metre across. They are ultra-strong and can be 
organised into larger fibres. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Cleaning windows </b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Professor Pugno also outlined three properties which a real 
Spider-man suit must demonstrate. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Firstly, and most obviously, it must be able to demonstrate 
strong adhesive properties. Secondly, the suit must be able to detach easily 
from a surface after it has stuck. Thirdly, the suit must, to some degree, be 
able to clean itself. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The latter requirement is considered important because dirt 
particles could get in the way, interfering with the adhesive properties of the 
suit. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">One way to do it is to make the suit &quot;superhydrophobic&quot;, so 
that it strongly repels water. As water droplets are forced away from the 
contact areas of the outfit, they should wash away particles of dirt. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This property could be achieved simply by altering the 
geometrical properties, or topology, of the surface. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&quot;To have all these mechanisms working together is 
difficult, because they are in competition with one another,&quot; Professor Pugno 
told the BBC News website. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&quot;But geckos and spiders provide a natural demonstration 
that this can be done.&quot; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">He added that there were many interesting applications for 
adhesive suits, in areas ranging from space exploration to defence. The work 
could also aid the design of gloves and shoes for window cleaners working on 
tall skyscrapers. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">But human muscles are very different to those of geckos, so 
people would probably suffer from muscle fatigue if they tried to stick to a 
wall for many hours. </p>
