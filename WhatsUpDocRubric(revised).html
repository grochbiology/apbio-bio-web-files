<P>&nbsp; What's up Doc and Mr. Potatohead Rubric Write up
requirements: (revised 10/2013)</P>
<P>&nbsp; Rubric: (36 points)</P>
<P>Title (must contain IV and DV information) (1 point) 
</P>
<P>Data Table (contains both carrot or potato in &ldquo;% change in
mass&rdquo;. Needs complete title, units, data centered in columns,
and only one horizontal line under column titles.(4 points) 
</P>
<P>Graph: needs a complete title, axes labels including units in
parenthesis, two trendlines with equations (for both carrot and
potato). X-axis has been modified to show minor gridlines. (4 points)
for both veggies</P>
<P>Laboratory Review Questions (Conclusion Questions): (remember
avoid all pronouns and sentences should never start with the word
&ldquo;it&rdquo;.)</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P>What did you observe during the demonstration using the
	artificial cell (dialysis tubing)? Draw the 2 beakers and show the
	flow of iodine, water, and glucose. Why did the dialysis tubing in
	beaker 1 with iodine turn purple? What evidence was there that
	glucose also moved from the dialysis tubing? Is dialysis tubing a
	good model for a living cell? Are there any problems with the model?
	(5 points)</P>
	<LI><P>Using the x-y scatter graph you made for carrots and
	potatoes. By hand calculate the isotonic point (where the line
	crosses the x-axis) which is the internal solute concentration of
	the carrot or the potato. Use the y=mx+b equation, set &ldquo;y&rdquo;
	to zero and solve for x. Show all your work for both calculations.
	(5 points)</P>
	<LI><P>Reflect on what you thought would happen to the carrots and
	potatoes overnight (original hypothesis). <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Does
	the data support or refute your personal&nbsp; hypothesis? Explain
	using data (your calculations, internal concentration of the veggies
	as evidence). (5 points)</FONT></FONT></P>
	<LI><P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Draw a
	diagram of how water moves when a veggie is in an isotonic solution,
	hypotonic solution and a hypertonic solution. (5 points) </FONT></FONT>
	</P>
	<LI><P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Compare the
	demo to the carrot and potato part of the lab, reflect on
	similarities and differences of both. Include the difference between
	diffusion and osmosis and relate the the 2</FONT></FONT><SUP><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>nd</FONT></FONT></SUP><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>
	law of thermodynamics in your comparison. (5 points)</FONT></FONT></P>
</OL>
<P>References: 2 minimum make sure you use the proper format APA (use
<A HREF="http://www.bibme.org/">bibme.org</A>) for credit. (example
this lab and the sections in your book, you'll also need to include
any references that you used to look up the answers to question #4
and #5). (2 points)</P>
