<body><p><b>Rubric for Got Protein:</b>&nbsp; (23 points)</p>
<p> <b><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">Title,&nbsp;&nbsp; Standard Curve Graph, Calculations including % error,&nbsp; Summary/ Conclusion; 
References (2 min).</font></b></p>
<p><u><b>Title</b></u>: must be descriptive and include the IV and DV of your 
lab experiment. (1 point)</p>
<p><u><b>Results: </b></u></p>
<p>Using class averages (if available) generate a <b>Standard Curve for BSA</b> 
(includes descriptive title, labeled axis, trendline and equation (y=mx+b).&nbsp; 
(4 points)</p>
<p><u><b>Calculations:&nbsp; (please do hand calculations, very difficult to 
type)</b></u></p>
<p>a) Given (expected); example the information on the side of the 2% milk carton 
reads 10g/240 mL; convert to micrograms/microliter. Soy milk (7g/ 240 mL), Rice 
milk (1g/240mL) 
(2 points)</p>
<p>b) Using the absorbance of your 3 unknown milk dilutions (0.1, 0.01, and 
0.001)... solve for "x" using the equation from the BSA standard curve. Remember 
your values will be in micrograms/microliter... multiply each calculation by 
either 10 (for the 0.1 dilution); 100 (for the 0.01 dilution), 1000 (for the 
.001) to get the actual value of your unknowns (6 points)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">c) Using the given protein content 
(from the milk carton) calculate the % error between your observed values vs. 
the expected results (milk carton) for each dilution.&nbsp; (3 points)</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">The formula for % error is </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">(Observed – Expected / Expected) 
x 100</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">Include % error for the two other milks... (use the 0.01 dilution, your choice of table data).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><u><b>Summary/ Conclusion&nbsp; (5 points)</b></u></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Discuss the purpose and results of the experiment,
the use of a spectrophotometer to determine a standard curve to find an
unknown concentration of a substance. Discuss how you were able to
determine the accuracy of your samples versus the information on the
side of the milk cartons. Discuss the possible places where errors
could occur during the set-up and execution of the measurement of
absorbance (think about the spectrophotometers, setting up the
cuvettes, etc.). Don't forget to include the use of a blank. Do not
forget to include citations after sentences for information you used
from other sources. Avoid pronouns.</p>
