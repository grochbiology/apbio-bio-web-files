<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none"><b>Crime Scene PCR Analysis 
Questions </b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none"><b>(from Bio-Rad and
<a href="http://www.lakesideschool.org/upperschool/departments/science/forensics/documents/Lab6-DNAfingerprinting_000.doc">
http://www.lakesideschool.org/upperschool/departments/science/forensics/documents/Lab6-DNAfingerprinting_000.doc</a> 
)</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">1. What is the genotype of 
each of your samples? If your samples did not generate PCR products, explain why 
that may have happened?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">2. Summarize the results of 
your gel; does the Crime Scene DNA sample have a genotype that matches any of 
the suspects? If so, which one matches? How conclusive would this be in a court 
of law (i.e. how definitive is this in terms of linking a suspect to a crime 
scene or implicating guilt)? Would the results of this analysis be sufficient to 
say with authority that the suspect whose DNA matched that of the crime scene 
committed the crime? Why or why not?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">3. What do your results tell 
you about which suspects should be included in the investigation? Excluded? 
Explain your answer.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">4. Imagine that each allele at 
the BXP007 locus is found at exactly the same frequency in a population. Since 
there are 8 possible alleles at the BXP007 locus, what is the frequency of any 
one allele from this locus in this population?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">5. Related to question 2 and 
question 4, if you had a pool of 13 suspects, and only one suspect had a 
genotype that matched the BXP007 locus found at the crime scene, would you be 
satisfied that you had identified the perpetrator based only on the genotype 
frequency calculated for the BXP007 locus? Why or why not? Explain your answer.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">6. <b>Case Study.</b> Find at least one case where DNA 
fingerprinting played a key role in the conviction of a criminal (besides those 
discussed in your text or in the case studies you reviewed in this class). Write 
a brief synopsis of the crime(s) committed (including names and dates where 
relevant), how DNA fingerprinting was used by forensic scientists (and 
ultimately the prosecution) and briefly summarize the court proceedings and the 
judgment. Finally, based on your experience with and research on DNA profiling 
(particularly STRs), do you feel this evidence should be admissible under the 
Federal Rules of Evidence? Should it be admissible in some cases and not others? 
How many loci should be surveyed to provide a conclusive test (you may need to 
do some research to see what states and countries require in terms of number of 
loci)? Be sure and cite all sources used, including books and websites, and 
definitely provide URLs for pictures that you might use.</p>
