<p>Focus Questions for Chapter 13: Genetic Engineering. and Chapter 14-3 Human 
Molecular Genetics</p>
<p>Chapter 13</p>
<p>1. Why do humans use selective breeding?</p>
<p>2.Why did Luther Burbank use hybridization?</p>
<p>3. Is inbreeding always harmful?</p>
<p>4. How do breeders genetic variation in population? How do scientists produce 
new kinds of bacteria and plants? Define polyploidy.</p>
<p>5. Define genetic engineering. What are the 3 tools listed on pages 322-323. 
Define and draw a picture of gel electrophoresis.</p>
<p>6.What is meant by DNA sequencing? How scientists determine the nucleotide 
sequence (the &quot;clever trick&quot;).</p>
<p>7. What does PCR stand for? How does PCR work?</p>
<p>8. Remember the pGlo lab? Describe the process (using Figure 13-9)of taking a 
human gene and using a bacterial cell to make a gene product (example in the 
book is human growth hormone).</p>
<p>9. What are the differences between transforming plant and animal cells?</p>
<p>10. How do scientists &quot;knock-out&quot; or eliminate particular genes?</p>
<p>11. What are the 3 types of transgenic organisms? What are the advantages of 
each type?</p>
<p>12. What is cloning and what are the hopes for this technology, what are the 
problems?</p>
<p>Chapter 14-3</p>
<p>1. What is the purpose of Human DNA Analysis?</p>
<p>2. Using the examples in the book how do scientists look for alleles?</p>
<p>3. Explain Figure 14-18: DNA fingerprinting; the purpose and process.</p>
<p>4. What is the Human Genome Project (HGP)? How did scientists accomplish this 
project (explain rapid sequencing)?</p>
<p>5. What do scientist hope to use the HGP for?</p>
<p>6. Explain what gene therapy is and what it can and cannot do at this time.</p>
