<ol style="margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in" start="1" type="1">
  <li class="MsoNormal">Why is life dependent on energy?</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">Where does the energy that living things need come from?</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">What is the ultimate source of energy for most living 
  things?</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">Compare and contrast autotrophs and heterotrophs.</li>

  as it burns.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">What is the main source of chemical energy in living 
  things?</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">Draw a diagram of ATP.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;Look at diagram 8-3.&nbsp; Explain what is going on 
  regarding ADP/ATP relating to a battery.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;How is the energy in ATP released?</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;What is ATP used for in cells?&nbsp; Give at least 5 
  specific activities.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;Why do most cells only have a small amount of ATP on 
  hand at any given moment?</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">
  <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;How do cells store 
  energy?&nbsp; (hint: what biomolecule is used to store energy?)</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">8.2</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">1. What do plants do during the 
process of photosynthesis?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">2. Briefly describe Van Helmont's 
experiment and what his conclusions were.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">3.&nbsp; Briefly describe both of 
Priestley's experiments and what conclusions he made for each one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">4.&nbsp; Look at the timeline...what did 
Jan Ingenhousz do and what did he conclude?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">5.&nbsp; Look at the timeline...how did 
Melvin Calvin contribute to our understanding of photosynthesis?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">6.&nbsp; Write the equation for 
photosynthesis.&nbsp; How does it compare to cell respiration?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">7.&nbsp; Where does the energy input come 
from that drives photosynthesis?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">8.&nbsp; What is chlorophyll and what is 
its role in photosynthesis?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">9.&nbsp; What are pigments?&nbsp; Draw a 
picture of a red pigment and what is does with light energy (remember that light 
energy has more than just red light waves, it has all the colors of the 
rainbow!).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">10.&nbsp; Look at figure 8-5, what light 
waves does chlorophyll a capture/reflect?&nbsp; What about chlorophyll b?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">11. Why do plants look green?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">12.&nbsp; What are carotenes?&nbsp; Based on 
that, explain why carrots were given their name.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">13.&nbsp; What happens to the light 
energy absorbed by chlorophyll?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;8.3</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">1.&nbsp; What are the light collecting 
units in a chloroplast?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">2.&nbsp; Where are those light collecting 
units located in the chloroplast?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">3.&nbsp; Look at Figure 8-7.&nbsp; Where is 
the ATP that is generated in the light dependent reaction used?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">4.&nbsp; What is a carrier molecule?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">5.&nbsp; What does NADP+ carry?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">6.&nbsp; What are the high energy 
electrons used for in a cell?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">7.&nbsp; What happens to e- that absorb 
light energy?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">8.&nbsp; How are the e- lost from 
photosystem II replaced?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">9.&nbsp; Look at your notes and at Figure 
8-10.&nbsp; Describe the flow of e- from water to NADPH.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">10.&nbsp; What is generated as e- flow 
from photosystem II to photosystem I?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">11.&nbsp; Study Figure 8-11.&nbsp; What are 
the reactants for the Calvin Cycle (the light independent reaction) and what are 
the products?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">12.&nbsp; What happens to all the carbons 
in CO<sub>2</sub> in the Calvin Cycle?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">13.&nbsp; What does the plant use the 
sugars for?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">14.&nbsp; Summarize the main functions of 
the light dependent and light independent reactions.</span></p>
