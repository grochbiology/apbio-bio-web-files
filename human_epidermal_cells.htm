<p ALIGN="LEFT">This activity requires the use of hazardous components and/or 
has the potential for hazardous reactions. Please review the</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">Safety Precautions section on the following page and relevant 
Material Safety Data Sheets before beginning this activity.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Procedure:</p>
</b></font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">
<p ALIGN="LEFT">1. Wash the underside of a wrist that will be sampled for 
epidermal cells with soap and water.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">2. Stick a clean piece of clear tape on the underside of the 
washed wrist.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">3. Gently remove the piece of tape from the wrist being careful 
to avoid getting fingerprints on the tape. A forceps might help</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">to remove the tape and avoid fingerprinting the tape.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">4. Place the tape, sticky-side up, on a clean microscope slide.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">5. Stain the top, sticky side of the tape with 2 or 3 drops of 
1% methylene blue solution.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">6. Use a dissecting needle to gently place a cover slip over the 
sticky tape. Lower the coverslip down onto the tape and then</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">remove the dissecting needle. This should help prevent staining 
your fingers. <i>Caution: Use methylene blue carefully. It</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">will stain most items including skin, clothing, and table tops.</p>
</i>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">7. Examine the slide under a microscope. Look for cells with low 
power first, and then switch to high power for details.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">8. Record your observations of epidermal cells by making 
drawings. Label your drawings with appropriate magnifications.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">Use your knowledge of the size of the microscopic field to 
estimate the size of the cells.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Discussion:</p>
</b></font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">
<p ALIGN="LEFT">There has been concern expressed about the classic activity in 
which students remove cheek cells from the inside of their</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">mouths. The procedure described in this activity eliminates the 
potential dangers inherent in collecting cheek cells from the</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">mouth. The cells secured from the wrist will be easy to find. 
Students may have to examine numerous cells before they find a</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">“nice” cell with nucleus, etc. Patience will yield good results. 
Students are likely to be amazed at how easy it is to remove cells</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">from the surface of the skin. The simple removal technique 
illustrates the fact that the skin is continually shed. Microbes and other</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">organisms are shed along with the skin thus helping in the fight 
against microbe invasion.</p>
<font FACE="Times New Roman"><b>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">Safety Precautions:</p>
</b></font>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">Methylene blue is a vital stain, it stains nearly everything, 
and it is difficult to remove. Prevention is the key when working</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">with vital stains. Wear chemical splash goggles, 
chemical-resistant gloves, and a chemical-resistant apron.</p>
