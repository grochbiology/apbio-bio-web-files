<P>AP Lab 4: Photosynthesis Rubric (35 points)</P>
<P><A HREF="http://www.grochbiology.org/LabAbsenceWrittenRequirements.htm"><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">absent
on lab day </FONT></A>&nbsp;(additional write-up requirements) 
</P>
<P>1. Title (descriptive contains IV and DV information) (1 point)</P>
<P>2. Abstract (1-2 sentences background, 1 sentence about lab
purpose, 1 sentence about general lab procedure, 1-2 about results
trend includes a statistic...Rf , R<SUP>2 ,</SUP> rate from trendline
equation, growth response graph standard error( PAR or light in
ft-candles vs transmission or absorbance ), 1-2 sentences about
conclusions drawn from results at both light distances). (4 points)</P>
<P>3. Results:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</P>
<P>&nbsp;a. Data Table includes: descriptive title, only one
horizontal line under column titles (unless there is a mean at the
bottom of raw data), columns titled correctly with units in
parentheses, sig figs correct (only as many numbers as the accuracy
of measuring tool also applies to calculations). Four columns: Time,
Table Data (state which machine used), Class Means for class
experiments (ex. light distance, different plants). (3 points)</P>
<P>b. up to 2 Graphs; at least one for your lab table experiment and
if the class did a light intensity experiment, one for photosynthesis
response (light app (in foot candles) or PAR (microMoles/sq m/sec)
vs. transmission or absorbance) show trendline equations using X-Y
scatter &nbsp; for each&nbsp; light trial, error bars (+/- 2 SD),&nbsp;
descriptive title, axes labeled with units in parentheses. (8 points)</P>
<P>c. Trend paragraph explaining what trends the data reveals in
general (comparing rates (ex. light distance or different plants) and
R<SUP>2</SUP>, use statistics (4 points)</P>
<P>d. Calculations of Standard Error (2 points)</P>
<P>e. Rf table averages for each pigment (3 points) title, columns
labeled (no units for Rf) (see lab for labels of each pigment)</P>
<P>4. Discussion/conclusion: must include data/statistics from lab to
support answers as well as cited information. Please address the
differences in reaction rates (clearing of DPIP) for two experiments
(ex. difference light distances, different plants) (please relate
information about the roles of light intensity, types of light,
nature of light, inverse square law as applies to light, light as a
source of free energy, chlorophyll, DPIP and NADP&nbsp; in light
reaction as well as the general importance of photosynthesis). Also
include a discussion of any difficulties and how those factors
impacts the experiments. (8 points) Include parenthetical citations
or use a superscript at the end of sentences.</P>
<P>5. References (2 min) must use proper APA format <FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 9pt"><B>(<A HREF="http://www.grochbiology.org/www.bibme.org">www.bibme.org</A>)
