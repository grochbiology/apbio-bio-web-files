<p class="MsoNormal">Science Fair comments to next year’s class:</p>
<ol style="margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in" start="1" type="1">
  <li class="MsoNormal">I should have done a better project that the scientific 
  world actually cares about.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">Our project should have been a little more scientific 
  than just testing nutrition facts, possibly make our project more helpful to 
  society.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">We should have made a scatter plot as opposed t o the 
  graphs. Also a Chi Square calculation every day as opposed to the 16 day 
  averages.&nbsp; We gathered much data for increased reliability.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">We should have gathered our data more efficiently.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">I should have spent more time rehearsing my speech (for 
  the judging). I did not expect to have to explain my project umpteen times.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">I should have done more work on the project (part of a 
  team). The other member did 60% of the work. I also should have spent a bit 
  more time refining some parts, and practicing what to tell the judges. Graphs 
  also needed some work.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">I should have done the experiment for a longer amount of 
  time to see if there was a difference between the stomata over time.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">There are a lot of things that I should have done. I 
  should have chosen a more interesting topic. I should have procrastinated 
  less. I should have done more work on it (the project). I should have worked 
  harder on the poster and I should have turned it (project parts) in earlier so 
  I could have had it to edit more.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">I should have had a better poster. I should have taken 
  more pictures.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">We should have measured the pollutants in the creek.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">The project contained variables that were unaccounted 
  for. One (variable) was how water hyacinth plants were not as similar as hoped 
  for. Next (variable) was the plants’ source of water, could have been 
  pre-contaminated.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">We should have had more spiders (sample size too small) 
  for the experiment. I think I smiled a bit too much (for the judges). Our 
  cheeks hurt a lot after the “interrogation” (judging). I don’t think our 
  project was very memorable. </li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">I saw some very cool projects at the fair and some that 
  were very original. I have a good idea for what I’d like to do next year.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">I think next time we should start the project earlier to 
  let us adapt to problems in the experiment. We also should have more 
  thoroughly measured the results (data?) with complicated and precise methods. 
  We also should have triple checked everything before putting it on (the 
  poster?). </li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">Typed up clearer to show (binder/poster) that the 
  experiment was done over a 3 weeks and to separate plants into 10 different 
  buckets and also measure (number?) stomata.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">We could have done a better job on enlarging the 
  important things on the poster and also possibly using the poster more as a 
  prop instead of just occasionally pointing to it (the poster during judging).</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">We should have rehearsed a little more and known more 
  about the results and recommendations (during judging).</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">I should have filled in the awkward silences by further 
  explaining the experiment.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">I probably should have given my spiel at a slower pace 
  (during judging). I tend to talk fast, and my first few speeches “DHEA” 
  sounded like some weird mixture of words. I also might have left out the fact 
  that the hermit crabs get the DHEA some days because they knocked their (food) 
  dish over.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">I think that the science fair was a difficult as I 
  thought it was. The judges weren’t too prying but a lot of them did ask the 
  same questions. A lot of the (other) experiments were more difficult and in 
  depth than ours (curing cancer). People were nice and it was interesting to 
  hear other people talk about their project.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">I should have made my poster neater, I should have 
  prepared my answers better, and I should have picked a more complex project 
  with more “straight-up” results. At the fair I saw posters with complex ideas 
  that inspired me to make a better project and enter it next year.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">We should have been more coordinated in standing and 
  replying to judges. With some judges, we weren’t sure who to have to reply (to 
  a judge’s questions). In other cases, we had a few slip ups in speaking. At 
  one time, we weren’t sure how to phrase words. At the fair, there were some 
  really fascinating projects. I would love to conduct a research experiment 
  like those. For instance, there was a sophomore who was researching a cure for 
  cancer. </li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">What we should have done better is that we should have 
  not been so nervous. The judges said that we should have been more prepared 
  than we were. One of the judges asked about our standard deviation and we had 
  no idea.&nbsp; Also some dude tried to solve cancer and really makes me want to go 
  to the fair again.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">I needed to articulate my words better… the judges were 
  leaning towards me to try and hear what I was saying.&nbsp; I needed to make my 
  poster less blank.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">What did I see that would make me want to participate 
  again: projects that had a real world application such as the tobacco 
  virus-solar cells?</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">We should have made the judges more interested in our 
  project. I was intimidated by the project across from us, he was curing cancer 
  for his project and he talked a lot.</li>
</ol>
