<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4">Directions: Work in your lab groups to 
answer the following questions, make sure each member of the group understands 
all the concepts. Any figures that are mentioned are found in the 8th Edition.</font></p>

  <li class="MsoNormal">What is an emergent property?</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">Why would evolution ( natural selection) support 
  mutualism and parasitism (two seemingly opposite life strategies)? Why are the 
  advantages and disadvantages of the following relationships +/+, +/-, +/0?
  </li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">Contrast the 3 different types of survivorship curves. 
  What are the advantages and disadvantages of each? How are these curves 
  related to semelparity and iteroparity? Why is “big bang” an appropriate 
  definition for either semelparity or iteroparity?</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">There is a relationship between climate (precipitation 
  and temperature) and terrestrial biomes, explain using examples.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">Explain the difference between J and S curves and relate 
  to R and K strategists and semelparity and iteroparity.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">What is the big deal about K (carrying capacity)?</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">What is the difference between the <font FACE="BerkeleyOldITC-Book">

  <li class="MsoNormal">In 2006, the United States has a population of about 300 
  million people. If there were 14 births and 8 deaths per 1000 people, what as 
  the country's net population growth that year (ignoring immigration and 
  emigration, which are substantial)? Do you think the US is currently 
  experiencing exponential population growth? Explain. (the equations are 
  located in Ch. 53.3) </li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">Check out figure 53.20, explain the population cycles of 
  the snowshoe hare and the lynx.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">Rank the types of behavior from innate to learning. Why 
  is learning (any type) an example of an emergent property?</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">There are at least 8 different ways of camouflage 
  (concealing coloration, disguise, disruptive coloration, aposematic coloration, mimicry, 
  deflection, countershading, masking) give an example of each in nature, name 
  some ways that&nbsp; humans utilize camouflage, see if you can find applications 
  for each of the natural versions (art, architecture, clothing, etc.)</li>

<p>Essential Questions:&nbsp; (Make sure you can answer the following general 
questions).</p>
<font SIZE="2">
<p>How do organisms interact within their environment? </p>
<p>How does energy flow through an ecosystem? </p>
<p>How is a community created? </p>
<p>How do the environments of organisms differ? </p>
<p>What factors affect the size of a population? </font></p>
