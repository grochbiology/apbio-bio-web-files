<a href="http://library.ucsc.edu/ref/howto/literaturereview.html">
http://library.ucsc.edu/ref/howto/literaturereview.html</a> </p>
<p>Part 1: General to specific.&nbsp; (2 to 5 paragraphs)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Includes a broad introduction to the subject you are 
investigating without mentioning your specific science fair project. The last 
sentence should reveal the thesis statement or question your review of the 
literature is evaluating.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Includes cited references (<a href="http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/560/03/">using 
APA style</a>)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Includes a paragraph explaining how you did your search 
for related research. Example: Google was used to search for topics related to 
____ using the following word search string: cattails&nbsp; there were 891,000 
hits. By adding &quot;marsh&quot; the number of hits was reduced to 299,000 and by finally 
adding sf bay&nbsp; the hits were reduced to 51,000. Adding quotes around the 
search string reduced the number to 4 which was too limited. Google Scholar.....</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last sentence should include the main organizing themes of 
the review the literature (which will also be the subject titles of the

freshwater algae will be examined in this review...)</p>
