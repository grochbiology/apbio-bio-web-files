<p>
You have been appointed to a jury to determine the guilt of a dog 
accused of biting a man. The case rests on DNA evidence. It is your 
responsibility to decide whether the evidence is enough to find the dog 
guilty.
</p>

<p>
<b>Procedure</b></p>

<ol><li><p>Read the evidence (see below) you have been given and discuss it as a jury.</p></li><li><p>Consider what other questions you would like to have answered about how DNA fingerprinting works. For example, you might ask:</p>
<ul type="circle"><li><p>Where in a crime scene might DNA be found?</p></li><li><p>How is a DNA fingerprint made?</p></li><li><p>What probability of DNA match would be considered statistically 
significant? Is 1 in 10 good enough? 1 in 10,000? 1 in 1 million? 1 in 1
 billion?</p></li><li><p>What are some of the problems with DNA fingerprinting?</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Use additional resources to research answers to your 
questions.</p></li><li><p>Think about what other questions are important in deciding this 
case, such as how the evidence was collected and processed and how 
important the DNA evidence is compared to other evidence in the trial.</p></li><li><p>Based on what you learned from your research and the other issues
 you have considered, decide as a jury whether you think the accused dog
 is innocent or guilty. Cite your reasons for your decision when you 
deliver your verdict.</p></li></ol>

<b>The Case of the Dog Bite</b>
</p>

<p>
<b>The Prosecution</b><br>
Taylor, a 38-year-old man, claims he was bitten by a pit bull named 
Buddy. He says that Buddy, who lives in Taylor's neighborhood, was loose
 in the neighborhood and attacked him without any provocation. After 
being bitten, Taylor claims he cleaned the wound with a towel and then 
rushed to the hospital. The bite required 10 stitches. Taylor had a 
local diagnostics laboratory extract DNA from the dog's saliva that was 
on the towel. DNA fingerprinting showed that five unique markers from 
the saliva matched markers from Buddy's blood. The odds that the saliva 
came from a dog other than Buddy are 1 in 350 million. There were no 
witnesses to the bite.
</p>

<p>
<b>The Defense</b><br>
Sam owns the pit bull named Buddy. He says that he always keeps Buddy 
locked up in the backyard and on a chain. He says he wasn't home the day
 that Taylor was bitten, but that when he got home that night, Buddy was
 tied up as usual. No one can verify whether Buddy was in the yard that 
day. Sam says there are three other pit bulls in the neighborhood and 
that one of them was the one who bit Taylor. Sam agreed to have Buddy's 
DNA tested.
