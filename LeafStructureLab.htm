<p class="MsoNormal">Lab:&nbsp; What are the structures of a leaf?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Background: The leaf of a plant is a specialized organ 
designed mainly for photosynthesis. With few exceptions, all other life depends 
on the functioning of the leaves of green plants. Various parts of the leaf 
structure perform different functions in helping the plant to live, to grow, and 
to produce food. This investigation will help you identify these structures. You 
will also see how leaves vary in size and shape. Leaves can be classified 
according to their type or form, the pattern of leaf margin, the arrangement of 
leaf veins, and the arrangement of leaves on the stem. The simplest types of 
leaves are found on mosses, which are called leaflets. Mosses are so small that 
they do not need a vascular system to distribute water and nutrients, osmosis 
and diffusion is enough. More complex plants include ferns, the conifers 
(gymnosperms), and flowering plants (angiosperms). Angiosperms are further 
divided into two categories; monocotyledons (monocots) with only one endosperm, 
and dicotyledons (dicots) with two endosperms. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Objectives:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Identify the main structures in a monocot, a dicot, and a 
conifer of a leaf</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Classify leaves according to leaf type, venation, leaf 
margin, and leaf arrangement.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Identify the various tissues and structures observed in a 
leaf cross section.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Describe how some leaf structures function.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Materials:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Various leaves (monocot, dicot, gymnosperms (conifer), 
moss, ferns, hand lens.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Procedure:</p>
<ol style="margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in" start="1" type="1">
  <li class="MsoNormal">Review Chapter 22. Please note there are examples of 
  leaf shapes, leaf types, leaf arrangement and leaf margins at the end of this 
  document.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">Obtain an example of a dicot leaf. Note the color of its 
  upper and lower surfaces in your journal.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">Most dicots have a blade, the broad part of the leaf; 
  and a petiole, or the stalk that connects the leaf to the stem. Look for these 
  parts on your leaf. Use a hand lens to observe the midrib, a large central 
  vein that runs the length of the leaf.&nbsp; Look for the smaller veins branching 
  out from the midrib to all parts of the blade. Record your observations and 
  draw and label your leaf in your journal.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">Identify the type of leaf type, leaf margin, leaf 
  shapes, and leaf arrangement on several types of dicot leaves. “Simple” leaves 
  are those with one whole blade. “Compound” leaves are made up of several 
  divisions called leaflets attached to one petiole. Compound leaves can be 
  further divided into two subgroups. &nbsp;“Palmately compound” leaves have several 
  leaflets that arise from the tip of the petiole. “Pinnately compound” have 
  leaflets that run along opposite sides of an extension of the petiole. Record 
  your observations and draw and label your leaf in your journal.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">Dicot leaves can be classified by venation, or vein 
  pattern. In “parallel venation:”, several main veins run the length of the 
  leaf. Most monocots hae parallel venation. A leaf with “net venation” contains 
  a netlike pattern of veins spread throughout the leaf. Hold each leaf specimen 
  up to the light, and identify the vein pattern. You may need to use a hand 
  lens to see the veins. Record your observations in your journal.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">Dicot leaves can also be classified by the pattern of 
  the leaf margin which include smooth, wavy, serrated (ouch), shallow lobed, 
  deep lobed, bristle tipped. Record your observations and draw and label your 
  leaf in your journal.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">Dicot leaves can also be classified by the type of 
  arrangement of the leaves or leaflets on the stem (small branch). “Opposite 
  arrangement” means the individual leaves are arranged opposite each other (do 
  not get confused with a compound leaf with leaflets connected to one petiole). 
  In “alternate arrangement” the leaves are attached at alternate positions on a 
  stem. “Whorled arrangement” means several leaves arise together around one 
  part of the stem. Record your observations and draw and label your leaf in 
  your journal.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">Dicot leaves can also be classified by leaf shape. Go to 
  the end of this document and identify the leaf shape of your samples. Record 
  your observations for each leaf.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">Obtain a monocot leaf. Observe the shape of the leaf 
  blade. Use a hand lends to examine the leaf veins. Notice that the lower edge 
  of the blade surrounds the stem forming a sheath. Record your observations and 
  draw and label your leaf in your journal.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">Obtain a conifer (gymnosperm) leaf such as a pine leaf 
  and examine its shape. Pine leaves (needles) are found in clusters that are 
  enclosed by a scaly sheath. Pine leaves grow in groups of 2 3, or 5 needles. 
  Record your observations and draw and label your leaf in your journal.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">Obtain a moss plant. Look at the leaf-like and root-like 
  structures with a hand lens. Record your observations and draw and label the 
  plant in your journal.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">Obtain a microscope slide of a dicot leaf cross section 
  (privet: Ligustrum). Examine the leaf under low power. Notice the arrangement 
  of the various layers of the leaf. Identify the upper epidermis, the top layer 
  of the leaf. Notice also the lower epidermis, the bottom layer of the leaf. 
  Both epidermal layers help protect inner tissues (layers) of the leaf. You may 
  see epidermal hairs, which cut down the intensity of bright light and slow 
  down water evaporation. These hairs may make the leaf surface feel fuzzy.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">Focus the leaf cross section under high power and 
  identify the structures inside the dicot leaf. Again locate the upper and 
  lower epidermis. Note the size of the epidermal cells and the fact that the 
  epidermis is a single layer of cells. Cells in the epidermis secrete a 
  substance called cutin that covers the whole leaf. Cutin resists water and 
  prevents the lea from drying out. Draw and label the cross section in your 
  journal. Use colored pencils to show the structures as they appear on the 
  slide.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">Move the slide so that you can focus on the lower 
  epidermis. Examine closely the openings, or stomata, in the epidermis. Through 
  the stomata, carbon dioxide passes into the leaf and oxygen and water vapor 
  pass out of the leaf. Also locate the guard cells that border each stoma. 
  These specialized cells change their shape to control the opening and closing 
  of the stoma. Label the stoma on your drawing.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">Locate a layer of elongated, rectangular cells just 
  below the upper epidermis. These palisade parenchyma cells contain many 
  chloroplasts, which appear as tiny green bodies in the cells. When light 
  strikes the chloroplasts, photosynthesis begins. Most photosynthesis occurs in 
  the palisade cells. Label the palisade cells in your drawing.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">Just below the palisade cells, you will observe the 
  irregularly shaped spongy parenchyma ells. Spongy cells contain fewer 
  chloroplasts than palisade cells. The spongy cells form a honeycomb pattern 
  with intercellular air spaces. These air spaces contain gases and connect with 
  the stomata in the lower epidermis. Label the spongy layer on your drawing.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">Together the palisade cells and spongy cells make up the 
  mesophyll layer. Label the mesophyll on your drawing.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">Move the slide sideways and locate a circular structure 
  in the mesophyll layer. Each circular unit is a cross section of a leaf vein 
  or vascular bundle. This view of a vein is similar to looking straight into a 
  bundle of straws. Label the vascular bundle on your drawing.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">Find the xylem and phloem cells within the vascular 
  bundles. Xylem cells generally have thick walls and are bunched towards the 
  top of the vein. These cells carry water and minerals to the leaf. Phloem 
  cells are thinner and are located towards the bottom of the vein. Phloem 
  carries food from the leaf to the rest of the plant. Surrounding and 
  supporting the vascular bundle are cells called the bundle sheaths. Label the 
  xylem and phloem on your drawing.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">Find a microscope slide of a monocot (Zea-corn). Find 
  the same features that you found on the dicot slide. Draw and label your 
  drawing.</li>
