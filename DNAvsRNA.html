Great question!  However, the real question is:  Why does thymine replace 
uracil in DNA?<p>
<p>
First, some clarification.  As you already know, the difference between RNA 
(<u>r</u>ibo<u>n</u>ucleic <u>a</u>cids) and DNA
(<u>d</u>eoxyribo<u>n</u>ucleic
<u>a</u>cids) is the existence of a hydroxyl (-OH) group on the 2' 
carbon of the ribose sugar in the backbone.  The removal of 2' hydroxyl 
groups from DNA does not occur after the DNA has been synthesized, but 
rather the 2' hydroxyl groups are removed from the nucleotides before they 
are incorporated into the DNA.  During 
<a href="http://www.madsci.org/posts/archives/may97/864141858.Mb.r.html">nucleotide synthesis</a>, a
portion of the nucleotide monophosphates (NMP's) are dehydroxylated to 
2'-deoxy-nucleotide monophosphates (dNMP's).  This means that GMP, AMP, 
CMP, and UMP are converted into dGMP, dAMP, dCMP, and dUMP, respectively.  
However, before being incorporated into the chromosomes, another 
modification, using <a href="http://www.expasy.ch/cgi-bin/show_image?K8&up">folic acid</a> as a catalyst, methylates the uracil in dUMP to form a 
thymine making it dTMP.  After further phosphorylation, dGTP, dATP, dCTP, 
and dTTP can be used as the building blocks to construct DNA.<p>
<p>
The important thing to notice is that while uracil exists as both uridine 
(U) and deoxy-uridine (dU), thymine only exists as deoxy-thymidine (dT).  
So the question becomes:  Why do cells go to the trouble of methylating 
uracil to thymine before it can be used in DNA?<p>
<p>
The answer is:  methylation protects the DNA.  Beside using dT instead of 
dU, most organisms also use various enzymes to modify DNA after it has been 
synthesized.  Two such enzymes, <i>dam</i> and <i>dcm</i> methylate 
adenines and cytosines, respectively, along the entire DNA strand.  This 
methylation makes the DNA unrecognizable to many Nucleases (enzymes which 
break down DNA and RNA), so that it cannot be easily attacked by invaders, 
like viruses or certain bacteria.  Obviously, methylating the nucleotides 
before they are incorporated ensures that the entire strand of DNA is 
protected.  Thymine also protects the DNA in another way.  If you look at 
the components of nucleic acids, phosphates, sugars, and bases, you see 
that they are all very hydrophilic (water soluble).  Obviously, adding a 
hydrophobic (water insoluble) methyl group to part of the DNA is going to 
change the characteristics of the molecule.  The major effect is that the 
methyl group will be repelled by the rest of the DNA, moving it to a fixed 
position in the major groove of the helix.  This solves an important 
problem with uracil - though it prefers adenine, uracil can base-pair with
almost any other base, including itself, depending on how it situates
itself in the helix.  By tacking it down to a single conformation, the 
methyl group restricts uracil (thymine) to pairing only with adenine.  This 
greatly improves the efficiency of DNA replication, by reducing the rate of 
mismatches, and thus mutations.<p>
<p>
To sum up:  the replacement of thymine for uracil in DNA protects the DNA 
from attack and maintains the fidelity of DNA replication.  (For
