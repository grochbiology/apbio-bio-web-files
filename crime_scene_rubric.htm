<p><a href="StudentManualCrimeScenceRFLP.pdf">Crime Scene</a> Rubric (40 points)</p>

<p><a href="GelDataTableForm.pdf">Blank Data Table</a>;
<a href="SemilogGraphPaper.pdf">Blank Semi-log Graph Paper</a>;
<a href="IdealDataTable.pdf">Ideal Gel Data</a> (just in case your gel didn't 
work... don't forget to put a note under the data table telling me that you used 
ideal data and why you used the data). Example of
<a href="exampleHindIIIgraph.pdf">HindIII Standard Curve Graph</a> of Lambda 
DNA.</p>
<p><font size="2">Write up... Semi Formal (Title Introduction/Background, 
Results (includes HindIII graph and your data table) and Conclusions (use 
questions in lesson 1,2,3 and 4 as guide) and references see class homework 
calendar for exact due date of this assignment)</font></p>
<p>1. Title (1 point) (make sure your title includes the independent and 
dependent variables of this laboratory activity)</p>
<p>2. Introduction/Background (contains cited sources)&nbsp; (10 points) (Make sure 
you include information on biotechnology in general, DNA fingerprinting- how 
individuals are different, mutations, etc, also include information on RFLP vs. 
PCR methods, and the use of electrophoresis in separating fragments.</p>
<p>3. Results: </p>
<p>**a) Data table representing gel results (5 points) NOTE: in order to obtain 
full credit for determining the basepair (bp) size of each of the fragments from 
CS, S1-S-5 you must use the semi-log graph listed below. (don't forget the title and figure #.)</p>
<p>b) Semi-log graph of HindIII used to determine fragment sizes (5 points) 
NOTE: in order to get full credit there must be evidence that you used the graph 
to get the data for filling out the data table) don't forget the title and figure #. </p>
<font size="5">
<p>(note if your data/gel was incomplete you must still include your original 
data table from your gel as well as the either ideal data or another group's 
data (make sure you cite that the data is borrowed from another group).</p><p><small>c)
an accurate picture/drawing of the gel (title, figure number) label all
parts (5 points) can be a picture with the ruler, don't forget title
and cite who took the picture.</small></p>
</font>
<p>(you may use the graphing paper from <a href="SemilogGraphPaper.pdf">this 
online link</a> and hand graph your HindIII marker data or generate a graph from MSExcel here is a link to help

</p>
<p>4. Discussion/Conclusion (must include discussion of results). (10 points) 
(Make sure you discuss not only your results but also how fragment/bands can be 
used to determine DNA fingerprint matches for paternity or crime scenes, hint 
look up STRs and&nbsp; CODIS.

). Give an example of a famous case and how DNA was used as evidence or
to exonerate (clear) a defendent (check out the Innocence project <a href="http://www.innocenceproject.org/">http://www.innocenceproject.org/</a> </p>
