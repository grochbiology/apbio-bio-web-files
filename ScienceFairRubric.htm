abstract is written after</B> you&rsquo;ve written the rest of the
report sections. The abstract must not be greater than 250 words and
it includes portions of the other report sections.&nbsp; So though it
appears first in the report, it is written last. 
</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">Rules for writing abstracts:</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">Avoid use of pronouns (I, we, our, my&hellip;)</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">Write in past tense 3<SUP>rd</SUP> person style</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">Single space, 10 font, indented</P>

<P CLASS="msonormal"><U>Statement of Purpose, Hypothesis, or Null
hypothesis Page</U>:&nbsp; The purpose includes your original
testable question.&nbsp; The hypothesis is generally written in an
&ldquo;If&hellip;, then&hellip; format.&nbsp; The null hypothesis
states that the variable will not have a measurable effect and the
outcome is unrelated to the variable.&nbsp; <FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><FONT SIZE=3>Note:

</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal"><U>Introduction/Research Rationale Page:</U>&nbsp;
The introduction restates your clearly formulated and testable
hypothesis as well as explanation of your idea, how you got it and
why you think the work in interesting and important.&nbsp; Include
what you hoped to achieve when you started the project.</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal"><U><B>Variables Page (can be on the the
Introduction page to save paper):</B></U> These changing quantities
are called <B>variables</B>, and an experiment usually has three
kinds: independent, dependent, and controlled. The <B>independent
variable</B> is the one that is changed by the scientist. In an
experiment there is only one independent variable. As the scientist
changes the independent variable, he or she <B>observes</B> what
happens. The <B>dependent variable</B> changes in response to the
change the scientist makes to the independent variable. The new value
of the dependent variable is <I>caused</I> by and <I>depends</I> on
the value of the independent variable.&nbsp; The number of dependent
variables in an experiment varies, but there is often more than one.
Experiments also have <B>controlled variables</B>. Controlled
variables are quantities that a scientist wants to remain constant,
and he must observe them as carefully as the dependent variables.&nbsp;
Some people refer to controlled variables as &quot;constant
variables.&quot; 
</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal"><U>Review of Literature</U> (5-15 pages) This
section of your paper is your report to the readers of work and
research conducted by others in the past that relates to your topic
and facts that help introduce the readers to the topic. 
</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal"><U>Research Materials and Procedure Pages(s)</U>:&nbsp;
List the materials that you used. Then explain step-by-step what you
did in your experimentation. If drawings will make it clearer, draw
them on separate pages and include them in this section. Explain any
materials that you constructed in detail.</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal"><U><B>Discussion Page(s)</B></U><B>:&nbsp;</B>
Explain the exact process by which you reached your conclusions after
comparing the control and experimental variables. Look at your graphs
and data tables before you write this section.&nbsp; This section
should flow logically so that the reader can easily follow your train
of thought.&nbsp; Compare your data with the null hypothesis, what
you would have expected if the observations you made were completely
unrelated to the effect you were expecting, or to your hypothesis,
the predicted results.&nbsp; 
</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal"><U><B>Conclusions Page</B></U>:&nbsp; Work out
your statistical analysis before you write this section. &nbsp;Summarize
your results referring to your statistical and error analysis. Be
sure to mention whether the results support the hypothesis or null
hypothesis.&nbsp; &nbsp;MAKE SURE YOU DO NOT INTRODUCE ANYTHING THAT
WAS NOT ALREADY MENTIONED IN THE PREVIOUS PARTS OF YOUR PAPER. 
</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal"><U><B>Recommendations Page(s):</B></U><B>
</B>Describe what you would do differently if you were to do this
project again.&nbsp;

<P CLASS="msonormal"><U>Data Tables:</U> &nbsp;Data from an
experiment must always be presented in a form that allows the results
to be readily communicated to other scientists.&nbsp; Give each Table
a number and a descriptive title and all columns are labeled with
units of measure.&nbsp; The independent variable (or variables) is
placed on the left.&nbsp; The dependent variable (or variables)
should be placed to the right.&nbsp; 
</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal"><U>Graphs</U>: Always use an accurate title for
the graph.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you don&rsquo;t know how to make graphs on
the computer using Excel, then be sure to use graph paper to plot the
points accurately.&nbsp; Always record the independent variable on
the X- (horizontal) axis and the dependent variable on the
Y-(vertical ) axis.&nbsp; Space intervals evenly along each axis, and
plot data points only at coordinates where data were collected.&nbsp;
Set the maximum values on both axes slightly above the maximum values
of the data.&nbsp; The data should never extend over most of the
graph&rsquo;s area.&nbsp;

<P CLASS="msonormal">This would include somethings as simple as the
mean, median, mode, standard deviation etc.

<P CLASS="msonormal"><U><B>Error Analysis:</B></U> Students often
assume that each measurement that they make in the laboratory is true
and accurate.&nbsp; Likewise, they often assume that the values that
they derive through experimentation are very accurate.&nbsp; &nbsp;
However, sources of error often prevent students from being as
accurate as they would like.&nbsp; Percent error calculations are
used to determine how close to the true values, or how accurate,
their experimental values really are. Examples for representing your
error analysis of data on the following&nbsp;&nbsp;
