<p align="center" style="text-align: center"><b>ENZYME RATE OF REACTION FOR 
HANDASE</b></p>
<p align="center" style="text-align: center"><font size="2">(from 
http://www.sc2000.net/~czaremba/labs/toothpick.html)</font></p>
<p><b>BACKGROUND INFORMATION</b>:</p>
<p>Chemical reactions make life possible. Hundred of chemical reactions are 
involved in the process of digesting a candy bar. If these reactions proceeded 
too slowly, not only would the candy bar remain in the stomach for long time, 
but the ordinary activities of life would come to a halt as well. Since this is 
not the case, something in the body must be responsible for speeding up the 
process. Four things that can speed up chemical reactions are: (1) heat; (2) 
increasing the concentration of reactants; (3) decreasing the concentration of 
products; and (4) enzymes, which speed up reaction without themselves being used 
up.</p>
<p>Enzymes are important in regulating chemical pathways, synthesizing materials 
needed by cells, releasing energy, and transferring information. Enzymes are 
involved in digestion, respiration, reproduction, vision, movement, thought, and 
even in the production of other enzymes. With few exceptions, enzymes are 
proteins. Simple cells may have as many as 2000 different enzymes, each one 
catalyzing a different reaction. An enzyme may accelerate a reaction by a factor 
of 10<sup>10</sup>;that is, making it happen 10,000,000,000 times faster. 
Thus, a reaction that might take place as long as 1500 years without an enzyme 
can be completed in just 5 seconds with an enzyme.</p>
<p>In this lab, your hands are the enzyme <b>handase</b>. This enzyme will split
<b>H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub></b> into <b>H<sub>2</sub>0 and O<sub>2</sub></b>. 
You will split the molecule by rippling the paper model down the middle.</p>
<p><b>Pre Lab Questions</b>:</p>
<p>1. What is an enzyme? What is its functions in living things? </p>
<p>2. What are things that can affect the function of an enzyme?</p>
<p>3 Write the chemical equation for the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide by the 
enzyme catalase. </p>
<p><b>Procedures</b>:</p>
<p>1 Cut out <b>50</b> hydrogen peroxide molecules from the paper template (<b>done 
for you</b>)</p>
<p>2. Place <b>50</b> paper hydrogen peroxide molecules into the yellow bowl.</p>
<p>3.<b> One member</b> of your group (the &quot;ripper&quot;) will do the following: 
while the others time and record data.</p>
<p>a) When told to, you will grab one hydrogen peroxide molecule lift it up from 
the pile so it is raised over the top of the bag and rip it down the middle<b> 
exactly on the line. Only rip one hydrogen peroxide molecule at a time</b>.</p>
<p>b) Place the 2 ripped in half pieces back into the paper bag and grab another hydrogen 
peroxide molecule. If you grab an already ripped piece you CANNOT RIP IT AGAIN, 
place it back into the bag.</p>
<p>e) Repeat steps a and b, <b>as fast as you can for 10 seconds</b>. A member of group 
will be timing you for 10 seconds. Another will record the data and make sure 
you are not &quot;cheating&quot;.</p>
<p>d) Empty your container and count the number of ripped hydrogen peroxide 
molecules.</p>
<p>e) Record the data in the following table. </p>

<p>4. Repeat step a - step e for 30, 60, 120, 180 seconds by adding another 50 
paper molecules at the end of each time course. Leave all the pieces in the 
yellow bowl until the end.</p>
<p>5. Graph the results.</p>
<p>6. Determine the rate of reaction for the following times. </p>
<p><b>The rate of reaction can be calculated by using the following equation: (M 
= number of molecules metabolized.&nbsp; The subscript represents the interval ( 
example to determine rate of reaction between 1-10 seconds: 0 is M1 and the 
number you ripped in half in 10 seconds is M2.&nbsp; T2 is 10 seconds and T1 is 
0 seconds)</b></p>

<p><b>HANDASE EXTENSIONS:&nbsp; Keep the same &quot;ripper&quot; as before. Make a new 
data table.&nbsp; Record the data.&nbsp; </b></p>
<p>A) Groups 1&nbsp; will place 40 hydrogen peroxide molecules into the yellow 
bowl + 10 
pink molecules.&nbsp; You may not tear the pink molecules, the represent a 
different substrate</p>
<p>B) Groups 2&nbsp; will&nbsp; place 100 hydrogen peroxide molecules into the 
yellow bowl.</p>
<p>C) Groups 3 will place 50 hydrogen peroxide molecules into a <b>larger</b> 
tray.&nbsp; 2 people will tear them at the same time.</p>
<p>D) Groups 4 will place 50 hydrogen peroxide molecules into the yellow bowl.&nbsp; 
Add 20 paper clips.</p>
<p>E) Groups 5 will place 50 hydrogen peroxide molecules into the bowl.&nbsp; The 
ripper will cross his/her fingers while ripping the molecules. </p>
<p>F) Groups 6 will place 50 hydrogen peroxide molecules into the bowl.&nbsp; The 
ripper will have his/her thumb taped to his/her palm.</p>
<p>Alternate Activity:</p>
<p>First 30 seconds (closed eyes, 50 handase molecules + 4 paper clips)</p>
<p>Next 30 seconds, have another student (eyes closed) compete with first 
student for handase molecules</p>
<p>Next 30 seconds: have another student (eyes closed) to stick fingers in the 
way of first two students competing for handase molecules.</p>
<p><b>Post Lab Questions</b>:</p>
<p>1. If you were allowed to continue this lab and rip hydrogen peroxide 
molecules for 240 and 300 seconds. What would happen to the rate of reaction and 
why will this happen?</p>
<p>2. What can you say about the length of time and the rate of the reaction? </p>
<p>3. What would happen to the rate of reaction if you remove the H<sub>2</sub>O 
and O<sub>2</sub> molecules as soon as they are produced? </p>
<p>
4.&nbsp; Explain how EACH extension affected the rate of reaction. What do each 
of these represent about things that affect enzyme activity?</p>
