<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2"><b>Water's History:</b>&nbsp; (must be read 
aloud with a deep announcer-style voice)... When life on Earth was beginning 
between 3 and 4 billion years ago, water provided a medium in which other 
molecules could interact.&nbsp; Life as we know it could not have evolved without 
these interactions.&nbsp; Today, 3/4 of Earth's surface is covered by water.&nbsp; Every 
cell in your body contains water.&nbsp; In most cells there is an abundance of it; 
about 2/3 of the molecules in your body are water molecules.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">Water heats more slowly than most other 
substances.&nbsp; It also retains its temperature longer than other substances when 
its surrounding environment cools - it store heat well.&nbsp; This keeps the 
temperature of areas surrounding large water bodies more stable throughout the 
changing seasons.&nbsp; Many organisms dispose of excess heat through water 
evaporation.&nbsp; For example, humans cool down by sweating. </font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">Water molecules readily form special 
bonds, called hydrogen bonds, with one another, so water clings to itself in an 
attraction called <u>cohesion.</u>&nbsp;(vocab word) It is because of cohesion that 
water is a liquid and not a gas at room temperature.&nbsp; Hydrogen bonds link many 
individual water molecules together at the water's surface, like a crowd of 
people linked by holding hands.&nbsp; Surface tension (vocab word) forms across the 
surface of water because of the cohesive attraction between individual water 
molecules.&nbsp; The attraction of water to a substance other than water is called <u>
adhesion</u>.&nbsp;(vocab word) Water adheres to any substance that it can form 
hydrogen bonds with (the substance is thus called <i>hydrophilic (vocab word), 
&quot;water loving&quot;</i>).&nbsp; Polarized molecules (that have a separation of + and - 
charges) will also form hydrogen bonds and are hydrophilic.&nbsp; Hydrophilic 
substances will mix with water; such as, water and vinegar mix together because 
vinegar is polar and therefore hydrophilic.&nbsp; That is why some things get &quot;wet&quot; 
and others, such as waxy substances, that are composed of non-polar molecules, 
do not (these substances are called <i>hydrophobic (vocab word), &quot;water hating&quot;</i>).&nbsp; 
The feathers on a duck are coated with a special non-polar waxy substance so the 
water forms droplets that roll, literally, right off the duck's back. 
Hydrophobic substances do not mix with water.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">The adhesion of water to substances with 
surface charges causes capillary action (vocab word).&nbsp; Capillary action and 
cohesion are responsible for the upward movement of water.&nbsp; For example, in 
plants, water moves upward from the roots, travels through the vascular system 
and, finally, exits through the leaves.&nbsp; Adhesion is also responsible for the 
meniscus present in liquids that are measured in a graduated cylinder.</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">Procedure:&nbsp; </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">1. Vocab:</font></b><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">&nbsp; 
List and define all vocab words from the reading.&nbsp; Underline the vocab word.&nbsp; 
There are six.</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2"><b>2.&nbsp; Read the directions for each event 
and place all responses in notebook:</b></font></p>
<p><u><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">Event #1: Demonstrate the 
adhesion/cohesion property of water, as well as surface tension.</font></u></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">1.&nbsp; Fill a glass with water and float a 
dry needle on the surface.&nbsp; You may need to use forceps/tweezers to aid in the 
success of this event.&nbsp; Don't get too frustrated by this...if you haven't had 
success after 5 tries, stop, write that down and explain why the needle kept 
breaking the surface.</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a.&nbsp; Record the time it took you to 
complete this task.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b.&nbsp; After making close observations 
(if you have a magnifying glass, use it)&nbsp; write down 3 observations about the 
floating needle.</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c.&nbsp; Why does it help to have the 
needle be dry?</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d.&nbsp; Which part of the activity 
demonstrated adhesion?&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Which part of the activity demonstrated cohesion?&nbsp; 
Why?</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">2. Obtain a clean, dry penny; set on 
table.&nbsp; Slowly drop water on its surface until the water spills over.&nbsp; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a.&nbsp; Record how many drops of water 
you added?&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. What did the water look like on 
the penny before it spilled over?</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c.&nbsp; Why were you able to get so many 
drops of water on the penny?&nbsp; Think about the vocab words.</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d.&nbsp; Why did the water eventually 
spill over?&nbsp; (in other words, why couldn't an endless supply of water drops be 
added to the penny?)</font></p>
<p><u><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">Event #2: Slip-n-slide: Demonstrate 
the hydrophobic properties of oil.</font></u></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">1.&nbsp; Mix one cup water and one tablespoon 
oil together in a dry, clean glass.&nbsp; Stir with a utensil.&nbsp; Let the mixture sit 
for about 2 minutes.</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a.&nbsp; Do the water and oil 
combine?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b.&nbsp; Is oil hydrophilic or 
hydrophobic?&nbsp; How do you know?</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2"><u>Event #3: Demonstrate the hydrophilic 
properties of detergent:</u>&nbsp; Detergent is composed of fatty acids in 
association with positively charged ions (cations) such as Na+ and K+.&nbsp; These 
associations, called &quot;soaps of fatty acids,&quot; are polar.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mix one cup water and one tablespoon 
detergent (laundry, dish or hand soap).&nbsp; Stir with a utensil.&nbsp; Let the mixture 
sit for about 2 minutes.&nbsp; </font></p>

combine?&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b.&nbsp; Is detergent hydrophilic or 
hydrophobic?&nbsp; How do you know?</font></p>
<p><u><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">Event #4:&nbsp; Demonstrate the dissolving 
abilities of hydrophilic vs. hydrophobic substances.</font></u></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">1.&nbsp; Add 1 tablespoon of oil to a small 
dry, clean glass.&nbsp; Pour a pinch&nbsp; of salt or sugar.&nbsp; Mix for one minute with 
a toothpick&nbsp; Let sit for a few minutes:&nbsp; stir the contents again for 30 seconds 
before observing.</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a.&nbsp; Does the salt or sugar dissolve 
in the oil?</font></p>
