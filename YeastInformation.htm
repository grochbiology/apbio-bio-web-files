  <h2>Looking after yeast</h2>
  <p>The quality of good beer depends on the quality and activity of the yeast 
  that is added to the wort during the brewing process. Many breweries keep the 
  yeast that is skimmed off at the end of one fermentation to add to the next 
  fermentation. Yeast is a living organism and needs to be kept in the right 
  conditions to keep it alive and active. Breweries choose fermentation and 
  storage conditions that suit their own variety of yeast. To do this they need 
  ways of checking how viable a batch of yeast is. Viability can be expressed as 
  either:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>the proportion of live and active yeast cells in a batch; or </li>
    <li>the number of cells present that will multiply and form colonies. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Yeasts are also used in breadmaking and to make flavourings, food 
  supplements, animal foods and important industrial enzymes. All these 
  processes depend on being able to keep active samples of the right strains of 
  yeast, ready to use in the production processes.</p>
  <p>Your assignment is to develop two separate standard procedures to check the 
  viability of samples of yeast. You will then use these procedures to decide on 
  the best storage conditions for the yeast.</p>
  <h2>What you have to do</h2>
  <h3>Microscopic examination</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Prepare a suspension of yeast by mixing about 1 g of fresh baking yeast 
    (or 0.5 g dried yeast) into 500 cm<sup>3</sup> of water at 20°C. Stir and 
    allow time for the yeast to disperse evenly through the water. </li>
    <li>Place one drop of the yeast suspension on a microscope slide. Add one 
    drop of methylene blue stain. Leave for 1 minute. Cover with a cover slip.
    </li>
    <li>Examine the slide under the microscope. If individual cells can be seen 
    clearly, count the total number of cells in a field of view and record how 
    many of them were stained blue. These are the dead yeast cells. If there is 
    a thick layer of cells, repeat the staining after diluting the sample of 
    yeast. </li>
    <li>Prepare a standard procedure for the measurement of the percentage of 
    viable yeast cells in a suspension of yeast. </li>
  </ol>
  <p>Plate count</p>
  <ol start="5">
    <li>Use a similar procedure to
    <a href="http://www.bsieducation.org/Education/14-19/topic-areas/applied-science/standard-procedure/sp-0003.shtml">
    SP 0003:2005</a> to count the number of viable yeast cells in a suspension 
    of yeast. Use sterile water for the serial dilutions. Use malt extract agar 
    in the Petri dish. </li>
    <li>Prepare a standard procedure for the measurement of the number of viable 
    yeast cells in a batch of yeast. </li>
  </ol>
  <p>Yeast viability tests</p>
  <ol start="7">
    <li>Use one of the procedures to find out three important facts about the 
    viability of the yeast sample:
    <ul>
      <li>How does freezing for short periods affect yeast viability? </li>
      <li>How does storage for several days or weeks in a refrigerator affect 
      yeast viability? </li>
      <li>How&nbsp;does the viability of yeast change over a period of time, while 
      the yeast is kept at 40°C? (This is called&nbsp;its 'viability' profile) </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h3>What you need to think about</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Methylene blue stains dead cells blue. Yeast cells that are alive 
    convert the methylene blue to a colourless chemical. </li>
    <li>The percentage viability can be calculated from the formula:<br>
&nbsp;<div id="formula" style="display: block; width: 440px; font-size: 95%; padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0; padding-top: 5px; padding-bottom: 5px">
      <div id="leftForm" style="display: block; float: left; width: 90px; padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0; padding-top: 5px; padding-bottom: 0">
        % viable cells =</div>
      <div id="rightForm" style="display: block; float: right; width: 350px; text-align: center">
        <p class="top">(total number of cells counted – number of blue cells) x 
        100</p>
        <p>total number of cells counted</div>
    </div>
    </li>
    <li>Consider how many cells should be counted to give valid results. What is 
    the best method of counting cells through a microscope? </li>
    <li>What other factors might affect the yeast viability? Are these going to 
    affect your procedure? </li>
    <li>It is important to use aseptic techniques when preparing dilutions and 
    setting up the cultures. Make sure that you know exactly what you are going 
    to do before you start. </li>
    <li>The appearance as well as the number of colonies after incubation can be 
    a useful source of information about the quality of the yeast. </li>
    <li>Consider doing several identical tests on the same sample. How 
    consistent are the results? </li>
    <li>re the methylene blue test and the plate count measuring exactly the 
    same characteristic of the yeast? </li>
    <li>Which procedure would be best to use to look at the viability of yeast 
    samples under different conditions? </li>
    <li>To obtain a viability profile you need to measure the yeast’s viability 
    at intervals while it is kept at a constant temperature. Use a water bath or 
    well insulated beaker of water. Allow a test tube containing 10 cm<sup>3</sup> 
    water to reach the test temperature. Add 1 cm<sup>3</sup> of a freshly 
    prepared yeast suspension and mix well. Sample the mix now and at 2 minute 
    intervals up to 12 minutes, transferring the samples to an ice bath. 
    Determine the percentage viability of each sample. </li>
    <li>Decide the best way to present your results to show how viability:
    <ul>
      <li>varies with changing conditions; </li>
      <li>varies over time at a particular temperature (the viability profile).
      </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Presenting your conclusions</h3>
  <p>Present the two standard procedures you drew up for testing yeast 
  viability, together with a report describing how one of these standard 
  procedures was used to test the viability of a sample of yeast under various 
  conditions. Present your results clearly and give your conclusions about the 
  viability of the yeast sample under different conditions.</div>
