ESSAY.  Write your answer in the space provided or on a separate sheet of paper.
51) Late one evening on Halloween eve two &quot;kind&quot; witches , both biology teachers were brewing a potion designed to make their AC biology students even smarter than they already are.  When the last ingredient was added they encountered a problem that could possibly afffect the outcome of the entire experiment!  Each of them didn't remember if they had already added just the right amount of sea salt to the potion. The problem is that without the right amount of sea salt, the potion will have the opposite effect on their students!  They decided that since it was already so late and they all were tired and hungry, they would just go ahead and bring the problem to their students to solve.   Your task  is to tell the teacher what they need to do  in order to  determine if they had added the right amount of sea salt or not.  Set up a simple experiment  by giving a list of steps that they should follow.  REMEMBER THE AC BIOLOGY CREED: &quot;NO HARM SHALL BEFALL THE ORGANISMS&quot;  so keep that in mind when you set up your experiment.    Use the paper provided...put your name on it please!!
