<P>&nbsp; What's up Doc and Mr. Potatohead Rubric Write up
requirements: Check Homework Calendar&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp; Rubric: (31 points)</P>
<P>Title (must contain IV and DV information) (1 point)</P>
<P>Abstract (1-2 sentences on osmosis and diffusion in general, 1
sentence summarizing the procedure, 1-2 sentences on the results
relating solute concentration to mass of carrot, use a number, ex.
isotonic concentration from graph or the trend value from equation,
1-2 concluding statement about the relationship between solute
concentration, water concentration and the movement of water in
carrots or potatos). (4 points)&nbsp; 
</P>
<P>Data Table (contains both class mean data and table data (note to
CP biology: that includes both tables listed in raw data Excel sheet)
for either carrot or potato. Needs complete title, units, data
centered in columns, and only one horizontal line under column
titles.(3 points) 
</P>
<P>Graph: needs a complete title, axes labels including units in
parenthesis, two trendlines with equations (class mean trendline and
table data trendline). X-axis has been modified to show tick marks
and the major gradations are in 5's, minor ticks in increments of
1's. (5 points) for your veggie only.</P>
<P>Post Lab Questions/Laboratory Review Questions: Answer one of the
question sets. (see below)</P>
<P>References: 2 minimum make sure you use the proper format for
credit. (example this lab and the sections in your book, you'll also
need to include any references that you used to look up the answers
to question #7 and #8). (2 points)</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Laboratory Review Questions (Conclusion Questions):&nbsp; <U><B>make
sure you pick one version of questions to answer and provide any
citations requested for full credit. Also remember incomplete
sentences, sentences starting with &quot;it&quot; or &quot;because&quot;,
or sentences using pronouns will not receive credit and you will be
asked to redo the assignment.</B></U></P>
<P>To Earn up to a C on this section answer questions 1-5 (7 points)</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P>What is the difference between diffusion and osmosis? 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Restate the hypothesis and use data (% change in mass) to
	state whether or not your veggie gained or lost mass in each of the
	sucrose solutions. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>If your veggie gained mass, that would mean that water
	____________ into the veggie. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>If your veggie lost mass, that would be mean that water
	____________ out of the veggie 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Write a short paragraph explaining the purpose of this lab
	and the role of sucrose in helping water move from either inside a
	veggie cell or out of a veggie cell.
