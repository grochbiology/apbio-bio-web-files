</b>
<p>Around 1900 it was discovered that there are at least 4 different kinds of 
human blood. This is based on the fact that on the surface of the red blood 
cells there may be one or more proteins, called <b>antigens</b>. These antigens 
are called <b>A</b> and <b>B</b>. <b>Antibodies</b> are produced in the blood 
plasma against these A and B antigens, and continue to be produced throughout a 
person’s life. </p>
<p>A person normally produces antibodies against the antigens that are <b>not
</b>present on his or her red blood cells. For example, a person with antigen A 
on his red blood cells will produce anti-B antibodies; a person with antigen B 
will produce anti-A antibodies; a person with neither A or B antigens will 
produce both anti-A and anti-B antibodies; and, a person with both antigens A 
and B will not produce these antibodies.</p>
<p>The 4 blood types are known as <b>A, B, AB and O</b>. Blood type O (persons 
with neither A or B antigens) is the most common in the United States (45% of 
the population). Type A is found in 39% of the population. Type B is 12% of the 
population, and type AB is found in only 4% of the population.</p>

<p>For the purposes of Rh incompatibility the Rh (Rhesus) blood group system 
operates as a one gene - two allele system. The gene product is identified as 
the RhD antigen or D antigen. The protein product of the gene is a transmembrane 
protein composed of over 400 amino acids. </p>

<p><img src="blank.gif" width="24" height="14">If a mother who is Rh <b>negative</b> 
(<b>rr</b>) is carrying a fetus who is Rh <b>positive</b> (<b>Rr</b>, must be a 
heterozygote), the mother has the capacity to produce immune antibodies to the 
Rh antigens on the fetal RBC. Fortunately, the mother's immune system does not 
come into contact with the fetal RBC until the time of birth when the placenta 
ruptures and some of the fetal RBC enter the mother's blood stream.<br>
<img src="blank.gif" width="24" height="14">So, the mother will make antibodies 
to the Rh antigens on the fetal RBC but the fetus has been born so it does not 
encounter mother's antibodies. However, the next Rh positive fetus will be at 
risk since the mother will retain a low level of circulating antibodies against 
the Rh antigen. This may lead to the death of fetal RBC late in the pregnancy 
when the mother loads the fetus with a sampling of her antibodies in a process 
known as &quot;passive immunity&quot;.<br>
<img src="blank.gif" width="24" height="14">But, if the mother's immune system 
is kept from seeing the fetal RBC, she will never make antibodies to the Rh 
angtigens. This can be accomplished by giving the new mother an injection of 
antibodies (made by someone else) directed against the Rh antigens on the fetal 
RBC. The injected anti-Rh antibodies react with the fetal RBC and the mother's 
immune system removes the antibody-antigen complex without recognizing the 
foreign Rh angtigen.<br>
<img src="blank.gif" width="24" height="14">The naturally occuring ABO 
incompatibility system operates in a similar manner and accounts for the lower 
than expected frequency of Rh incompatibile births. An ABO incompatible mating 
is one in which the mother has serum antibodies (anti-A or anti-B or both) 
directed against the antigens on the RBC of the fetus. Thus, an O-type mother 
who is Rh negative would have both anti-A and anti-B antibodies in her serum. If 
her fetus was A or B and Rh positive, her anti-A and anti-B antibodies would 
clear the fetal RBC and she would not have a chance to make antibodies against 
the Rh antigens on the fetal RBC.</p>

<p>Because of the different blood types, certain blood groups can only give or 
receive blood from other specific blood groups:</p>

<p>If blood cells are mixed with antibodies the cells will clump together. This 
is called <b>agglutination</b>. This is why it can be very dangerous if you 
receive the wrong blood type in a transfusion.</p>
<p>Blood typing is performed by mixing a small sample of blood with anti-A or 
anti-B antibodies (called <b>antiserum</b>), and the presence or absence of 
clumping is determined for each type of antiserum used. If clumping occurs with 
only anti-A serum, then the blood type is A. If clumping occurs only with anti-B 
serum, then the blood type is B. Clumping with both antiserums indicates that 
the blood type is AB. No clumping with either serum indicates that you have 
blood type O. Here are some examples:</p>

<p>A person’s blood type is inherited from their parents, just like any other 
genetic trait. Persons with blood type A have inherited one or two copies of the 
gene for the A antigen, one from each parent. Persons with blood type B have 
inherited one or two copies of the gene for the B antigen. Persons with blood 
type AB have inherited on copy of the A antigen from one parent and one copy of 
the B antigen gene from the other parent. Persons with blood type O inherited 
neither A nor B genes from their parents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Blood typing can be used in legal situations involving identification or 
disputed paternity. In paternity cases a comparison of the blood types of 
mother, child, and alleged father may be used to exclude a man as the possible 
parent of a child. For example, a child with the blood type AB whose mother is 
type A could not have a father whose blood type is A or O. The father must have 
blood type B.</p>

  #4.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="6">
  <li>Add 2 drops of the anti-A serum to each A well of the four slides.</li>

<p>9. Do any of the wells clump (agglutinate) or not? (it will look a little 
like light strawberry jam) Record your observations and results in your journal. 
What are the blood types of each of the 4 samples?</p>
