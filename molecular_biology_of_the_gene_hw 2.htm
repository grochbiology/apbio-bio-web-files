<p class="MsoNormal">These pages explain how the information in a gene is used 
to build a protein (GENE EXPRESSION/aka PROTEIN SYNTHESIS).&nbsp; Review the process 
of transcription and translation by filling in the blanks.&nbsp; THIS IS DIFFERENT 
FROM DNA REPLICATION.:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first step in making a protein is 
transcription (REWRITING THE <b>DNA CODE</b> INTO A DIFFERENT (mRNA CODON&nbsp; 
LANGUAGE) of a gene.&nbsp; This occurs in the ______________ of a eukaryotic cell.&nbsp; 
An enzyme called ______________ carries out the process of transcribing RNA from 
the DNA. It starts at a specific nucleotide sequence called a _________________, 
nest to the gene.&nbsp; RNA polymerase attaches, and the two DNA strands separate.&nbsp; 
RNA polymerase moves along one strand, and as it does, RNA ____________ take 
their places one at a time along the DNA template.&nbsp; They hydrogen bond with 
complementary bases; following the same pairing rules as in DNA – C with G and U 
(replacing T in RNA) with A.&nbsp; As the RNA molecule elongates, it peels away from 
the DNA.&nbsp; Finally, the enzyme reaches the __________, a base sequence that 
signals the end of the gene, and the polymerase molecule lets go of the gene and 
the RNA molecule.&nbsp; In a prokaryote, the RNA transcribed from a gene, called 
_________________(mRNA), can be used immediately in polypeptide (protein) 
synthesis.&nbsp; In a<b> eukaryotic cell</b>, the RNA is further modified, or 
_______________, before leaving the nucleus as mRNA.&nbsp; Extra nucleotides are 
added to the end&nbsp; 5’ and 3’ ends of the transcript, and noncoding regions called 
_____________are removed. The extra nucleotides with a series of GGGG’s&nbsp; is 
added to the ______ end and is called the ___________ while the series of 
AAAAA’s is added to the _______ end and is&nbsp; called the __________. Respectively, 
the GGGGG’ help the mRNA to get out of the nucleus and find its way to a 
ribosome, while the AAAAA’s keep the mRNA from being degraded or damaged, giving 
it a longer “life span”.&nbsp; The remaining _________________are spliced together to 
form a continuous coding sequence.&nbsp; The finished mRNA leaves the nucleus and 
enters the ________________ where translation of mRNA CODONS takes place. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Translation of the “words” of the mRNA message 
into the _________________sequence of a protein requires an interpreter 
____________________(tRNA) – which links the appropriate 
______________________with each _________________________in the mRNA message.&nbsp; A 
tRNA molecule is a folded strand of RNA.&nbsp; At on end, a special 
_______________attaches a specific amino acid.&nbsp; The other end of the tRNA 
molecule bears three bases called the _________________, which is complementary 
to a particular mRNA codon. During the translation process, the tRNA matches its 
amino acid with an mRNA codon.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ________________are the “factories” where the 
information in mRNA is translated and polypeptide chains are constructed. A 
ribosome consists of two subunits, one large and one small.&nbsp; They only come 
together after the mRNA binds first to the small subunit.&nbsp; A ribosome consists 
of protein and __________(rRNA).&nbsp; Each ribosome has a groove that serves as a 
binding site for mRNA.&nbsp; There are two binding sites for tRNA and one release 
site for tRNA: The P site holds the tRNA carrying the growing&nbsp; ________________, 
while the A site holds a tRNA bearing the next amino acid. Ribosomes also have a 
____ site where the tRNA leaves the ribosome. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Translation begins with initiation.&nbsp; An mRNA 
and a special _______________tRNA bind to the ribosome and a specific mRNA 
codon, the _________________where translation begins.&nbsp; The initiator tRNA 
generally carries the amino acid methionine (Met).&nbsp; It’s anticodon UAC binds to 
the start codon, AUG.&nbsp; The initiator tRNA fits into the ___ site on the 
ribosome. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next step in ______________synthesis is 
elongation – adding amino acids to the growing chain.&nbsp; The anticodon of an 
incoming tRNA, carrying its amino acid, pairs with the mRNA codon at the open A 
site.&nbsp; With help from the ribosome, the polypeptide separates from its tRNA and 
forms a peptide bond with the _____________attached to the tRNA in the A site.&nbsp; 
Then the “empty” tRNA in the P site shifts to the _____ site and leaves the 
ribosome, and the tRNA in the A site, with the polypeptide chain, is shifted to 
the P site.&nbsp; The mRNA and the tRNA move as a unit, allowing the next codon to 
enter the A site.&nbsp; Another tRNA, with a complementary anticodon, brings its 
amino acid to the A site.&nbsp; Its amino acid is added to the chain, the tRNA 
leaves, and the complex shifts again.&nbsp; In this way, ______________are added to 
the chain, one at a time.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally a ___________reaches the A site of the 
_____________________, terminating the polypeptide. When a ribosome reaches a 
termination codon on mRNA, the A site of the ribosome accepts a protein called a 
release factor instead of tRNA.&nbsp; The release factor breaks the bond between the 
tRNA in the P site and the polypeptide is freed from the ribosome.&nbsp; A stop codon 
causes the polypeptide to separate from the last tRNA and the ______________.&nbsp;
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The polypeptide folds up into the secondary structure, or 
it may join with other polypeptides to form a larger ____________molecule.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In eukaryotic organisms, cells become specialized - 
differentiated - for different functions.&nbsp; It has been demonstrated in 
several kinds of plants and animals that differentiated cells retain a complete 
set of genes for making all the specialized cells in the whole organism.&nbsp; 
Each differentiated cell has all the genes, but different genes are active in 
different kinds of cells.&nbsp; Check your understanding of this concept by 
coloring in the boxes below to show which genes you think would be active in 
each of the cell types:</p>
