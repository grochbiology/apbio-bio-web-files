<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Central Dogma and Gene Expression and
Control ECA</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Central Dogma</p>
<ol><li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">What is meant by gene expression?
	What is a biochemical (metabolic) pathway? What is the consequence
	of any genetic changes to a member (protein) of a pathway?</p>
	</li><li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Describe the general method of the
	flow of information from DNA to RNA to protein. Who coined the term
	&#8220;central dogma&#8221;? What is the exception to central dogma (see
	page 328 in Campbell 8). Compare and contrast informational flow in
	prokaryotes with eukaryotes. Discuss mRNA processing of the primary
	transcipt.</p>
	</li><li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">What is the relationship of
	complementary nucleotides to information flow in DNA and RNA? Why
	did evolution settle on codons as triplet nucleotides? What does the
	&#8220;dictionary&#8221; of genetic code (figure 17.5) reveal about the
	relationship between triplet codons and amino acids? What are some
	of the exceptions to the universality of the genetic code in terms
	of amino acids? (page 331).</p>
	</li><li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">In general, describe the process
	of initiation, elongation, and termination in transcription. How is
	the product of eukaryotic transcription processed? (hint: 5' cap,
	poly-A tail, RNA splicing, exons, introns, snRNPs, splicesomes). 
	</p>
	</li><li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Is there any use for excised
	introns (alternative RNA splicing and exon shuffling)?</p>
	</li><li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">In general, describe the process
	of translation. (include tRNA, rRNA, anti-codon, AUG (methionine),
	codon recognition, peptide formation, translocation, termination).</p>
	</li><li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Describe the features of
	post-transcriptional modifications (what happens to the protein
	after translation?). (targeting polypeptides for specific
	locations).</p>
	</li><li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">What are the various ways (and
	types) mutations can affect protein structure and function? (types
	of point mutations-single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP)... base
	pair substitution, silent mutation, misssense mutation, nonsense).
	Base pair insertion or deletion...frameshift.</p>
	</li><li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Compare gene expression in
	bacteria to archaea and eukarya (section 17.5).</p>
	</li><li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">How has the definition of a gene
	been modified since genomic sequencing? (17.5) 
	</p>
</li></ol>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Gene Expression in Prokaryotes and
Eukaryotes</p>
<ol><li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Explain the operon in prokaryotes.
	Contrast inducible with repressible operons.</p>
	</li><li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">What is meant by differential gene
	expression?</p>
	</li><li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Discuss the different ways
	(levels) that eukaryotic genes are regulated. Include: 
	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">a) regulation of chromatin (histone
	modifications, high levels acetylation (-COCH<sub>3</sub>) of lysine
	or deacetylation and methylation , heterochromatin, euchromatin), 
	</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">b) DNA methylation (-CH<sub>3</sub>)
	of cytosine and genomic imprinting of maternal/paternal genes;</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">c) Epigenetic inheritance outside the
	nucleotide sequence (reversible changes) mystery yet to be solved</p>
</li></ol>
<ol start="4"><li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">How do activators and enhancers
	help with the regulation of transcription initiation?</p>
	</li><li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">What is the role of  RNA
	processing and mRNA degradation in &#8220;fine tuning&#8221; transcription?
	What can be done to control translation? What is the role of protein
	processing and degradation in &#8220;post&#8221; translational?</p>
	</li><li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Describe the role of non-coding
	RNA's (not expressed as proteins) in controlling gene expression.</p>
	</li><li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Discuss the importance of cell
	differentiation and morphogenesis shape organismal shape. Include
	the role of cytoplasmic determinants, induction, pattern formation, 
	HOX (homeobox or homeotic) genes, maternal effect genes,
	egg-polarity, bicoid, and morphogens).</p>
	</li><li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">How do cells become cancerous?</p>
