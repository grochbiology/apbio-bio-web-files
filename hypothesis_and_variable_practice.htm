<p class="MsoNormal">Hypothesis and Variable Practice: For each of the scenarios 
below answer questions A-C.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<ol style="margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in" start="1" type="A">
  <li class="MsoNormal">Identify the Independent Variable (IV), Dependent 
  Variable (DV), Standardized or Controlled Variable (SV), the number of 
  repeated trials, and the control setup (if present).</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">Identify the Hypothesis for the experiment. If the 
  hypothesis is not stated, write one for the scenario.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">Identify 2 ways the experiment can be improved.</li>
</ol>

<p class="MsoNormal">Scenario 1: Gloria wondered if the height of a hole punched 
in the side of a quart sized milk carton would effect how far from the container 
a liquid would spurt when the carton was full of liquid. She used 4 identical 
cartons and punched the same size hole in each. The hole was placed at a 
different height on one side of each of the containers. The height of the holes 
varied in increments of 5 cm, ranging from 5 to 20 cm from the base of the 
carton. She blocked the holes with her finger and filled the cartons to a height 
of 25 cm with water. When each carton was filled to the proper level, she placed 
the cartons on the edge of the sink and removed her finger. Gloria measured how 
far away from the carton’s base the water had squirted when it hit the bottom of 
the sink.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Scenario 2:&nbsp; Sam wanted to find out if the color of food 
would affect kindergarten children lunch selections. Sam put food coloring into 
4 identical bowls of mashed potatoes. The colors were red, green, yellow, and 
blue. Each child would choose the color of their choice. Sam did this experiment 
using 100 children. He recorded the selection color for each student.</p>
