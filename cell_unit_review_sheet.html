&nbsp;5.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;When a white blood cell from the immune

bacteria inside&nbsp; by wrapping the bacteria with the the membrane
bilayer of the white blood cell, the cell has undergone ______ .<br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;

of molecules all at once a vesicle migrates to the cell membrane, fuses
and dumps the hormone out of the cell. This is an example of:
________________.<br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;7.&nbsp;&nbsp;

interfering with the ability of the cell to form (make) proteins?<br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;9.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Which organelle is responsible for making lipids and hormones? <br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;10.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;What cellular structure allows a vesicle
filled with adrenaline to move towards the cell membrane for excretion
out of the cell and in to the blood?<br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;11.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Which organelle is responsible for

biologist has three solutions and the labels have washed off. One
solution was salt water with a concentration of salt higher than a
living cell. the other two solutions are distilled water and pond water
(fresh water). The biologist wants to determine which solution is salt
water by placing several fresh water amoebas (small unicellular
eukaryotes) into each solution. Use the following answers to answer the
next 2 questions<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;24.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The amoeba in salt water will__________<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;25.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The amoeba in the distilled water solution will__________<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;27.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;How are prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells
similar and how are these cells different. Provide at least 2
differences and 2 similarities and some example organisms.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;

what are the different level of organization. Why have scientists added
the new level entitled domains? Why have archaebacteria been given
