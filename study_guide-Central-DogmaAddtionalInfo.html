	<LI><P>Which one of the following sequences best describes the flow
	of information when a gene directs the synthesis of a cellular
	component? &nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>2) The transfer of genetic
	information from DNA to RNA is called &nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>3)
	Experiments have demonstrated that the &quot;words&quot; of the
	genetic code (the units that specify amino acids) are &nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>4)
	A base substitution mutation in a gene sometimes has no effect on
	the protein the gene codes for.&nbsp; Which of the following factors
	could account for this? &nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>5) Which of the
	following enzymes catalyzes the linking together of RNA nucleotides
	to form RNA? &nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>6) Which one of the following
	occurs when RNA polymerase attaches to the promoter DNA? &nbsp;<BR>7)
	Where do transcription and translation occur in prokaryotic cells?&nbsp;
	<BR>&nbsp;<BR>8) Any change in the nucleotide sequence of the DNA of
	a gene is called&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp;<BR>9) Which of the following
	features would characterize a lytic cycle of viral infection?&nbsp;
	<BR>&nbsp;<BR>10) The term gene expression refers to the&nbsp;

	transcribed on a single mRNA molecule is called a(n)&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp;<BR>12)
	Most differentiated cells retain&hellip;. <BR>&nbsp;<BR>13) The

	the following permits a single gene to code for more than one
	polypeptide?&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp;<BR>15) A particular protein is 400
	amino acids long. How many nucleotide base pairs in the template
	strand of DNA are required to code for this protein?&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp;<BR>16)
	When examining the genetic code, it is apparent that:&nbsp;&nbsp;

	RNA is as follows:&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp;<BR>18) The following is a
	short segment of an mRNA molecule. The polypeptide it codes for is

	methionine-valine-leucine-lysine &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>A mutation
	in the DNA occurs so that the fourth base (counting from the 5' end)
	in the messenger RNA now reads A rather than G. What sequence of
	peptides will the mRNA now code for? (You do not need a copy of the
	genetic code to answer the question.)&nbsp; <BR>19) This diagram
	shows the major components of the central dogma of molecular biology
	as described in your text. The three numbered arrows represent which
	three major processes related to that central dogma? <BR><BR>&nbsp;<IMG SRC="centraldogma.jpg" NAME="graphics1" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=264 HEIGHT=247 BORDER=0><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;
