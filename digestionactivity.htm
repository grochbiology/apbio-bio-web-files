</B></U></FONT><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS" SIZE=2>
<P>Background:  When food enters the stomach, glands responsive to pressure secrete hydrochloric acid (HCl), thus lowering the pH of the digestive environment.  Why do you think some enzymes are capable of digesting food in the stomach while others do not?  Why would amylase and maltase <U>not</U> catalyze (breakdown) carbohydrates in the stomach?  Formulate a hypothesis to test why amylase and maltase do not have any digestive activity in the stomach.</P>

<P>Prelab:</P>
<P>1.  Hypothesis, Null Hypothesis, SV, IV, DV and control.</P>
<P>2.  What do you predict will happen when you test your hypothesis.</P>
<P>3.  Design an experimental procedure to test your hypothesis.  </P>
<P>4.  What materials will you need to carry out this experiment?</P>
<P>5.  How will you be able to tell if your experiment supports your hypothesis?</P>
<P>6.  Design a data table to record your results.</P>

<P>Post Laboratory Questions:</P>
<P>1.  Do your observations support your hypothesis?  Discuss how your data does or does not support your hypothesis.</P>
<P>2.  Do your observations support your null hypothesis? Discuss how your data does or does not support your hypothesis.</P>
<P>3.  What can you conclude about enzymes and pH?</P>

<P>1.  Draw, trace or copy a diagram of the digestion system.  This should be labeled by YOU.  It represents your digestive system.</P>

<P>2.  You have just eaten a cheeseburger with mayonnaise, lettuce and tomato. Number your diagram in the order in which the cheeseburger moves through your system.  (So, at this point, your picture has parts named and numbered.)</P>

<P>3.  Make a key to go along with your diagram.  This key should have three things:</P>
<P>&#9;a.  The name of the enzyme or substances that help digest the sandwich.</P>
<P>&#9;b.  In general, what does this enzyme do?</P>
<P>&#9;c.  Specifically, what part of the sandwich is being digested.</P>
