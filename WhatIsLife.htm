<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: center">“What is Life?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">BEFORE YOU READ THIS 
PASSAGE: In your journal, list three characteristics that all living things 
share. Below it, write a 2-5 sentence explanation of why you believe you are a 
living organism.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">READ: The passage below is 
from <i>The Andromeda Strain</i> by Michael Crichton (pp. 193-196). Write down 
any words or concepts that you do not recognize or understand in your journal.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">AFTER YOU READ THIS 
PASSAGE: Write two definitions of life, one sentence each, in your journal. The 
first should be your interpretation of “group’s” definition from the passage you 
just read. The second definition should be your own definition of life (on Earth 
or beyond). Then describe evolution and the origin of life (keep in mind these 
words are different concepts).</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Amino 
acids are the building blocks of proteins. There are twenty-four known amino 
acids, each composed of a half-dozen molecules of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and 
nitrogen. Proteins are made by stringing these amino acids together in a line, 
like a freight train. The order of stringing determines the nature of the 
protein- whether it is insulin, hemoglobin, or growth hormone. All proteins are 
composed of the same freight cars, the same units. Some proteins have more of 
one kind of car than another, or in a different order. But that is the only 
difference. The same amino acids, the same freight cars, existed in human 
proteins and flea proteins…</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But what 
controls the order of amino acids in the protein? The answer turns out to be 
DNA, the genetic-coding substance, which acts like a switching manager in a 
freight yard. All the amino acids, the freight cars, must be lead to the correct 
train…</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But then 
once the amino acids are strung together, they begin to twist and coil upon 
themselves; the analogy becomes closer to a snake than a train. The manner of 
coiling is determined by the order of acids, and is quite specific; a protein 
has to be coiled in a certain way, and no other, or it fails to function…</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a 
moment, he tried to imagine life without proteins. It was almost impossible; on 
Earth, proteins are part of the cell membrane, and comprise all the enzymes 
known to man. (Not true any more RNA can act as an enzyme). And life without 
enzymes is that possible?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He recalled 
the remark of George Thompson, the British biochemist, who had called enzymes 
the “matchmakers of life.” It was true; enzymes acted as catalysts for all 
chemical reactions, by providing a surface for two molecules to come together 
and react upon. There were hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of enzymes, 
each existing solely to aid a single chemical reaction. Without enzymes, there 
could be no chemical reactions.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without 
chemical reactions, there could be no life.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or could 
there?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a 
long-standing problem… How do you study a form of life totally unlike any you 
know? How would you even know it was alive?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This was not an academic matter. Biology, as 
George Wald had said, was a unique science because it could not define its 
subject matter. Nobody had a definition for life. Nobody knew what it was, 
really. The old definitions- an organism that showed ingestion, excretion, 
metabolism, reproduction, and so on- were worthless. One could always find 
exceptions.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The group 
had finally concluded that energy conversion was the hallmark of life. All 
living organisms in some way took in energy- as food, or sunlight- and converted 
it into another form of energy, and put it to use. (Viruses were the exception 
to this rule, but the group was prepared to define viruses as nonliving 
organisms).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the 
next meeting, Leavitt was asked to prepare a rebuttal to the definition. He 
pondered it for a week and returned with three objects: a swatch of black cloth, 
a watch, and a piece of granite. He set them down before the group and said, 
“Gentlemen, I give three living things.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He then 
challenged the group to prove that they were not living. He placed the black 
cloth in the sunlight; it became warm. This, he announced, was an example of 
energy conversion- radiant energy to heat.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was 
objected that this was merely passive energy absorption, not conversion. It was 
also objected that the conversion, if it could be called that, was not 
purposeful. It served no function.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “How do you 
know it is not purposeful?” Leavitt had demanded.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They then 
turned to the watch. Leavitt pointed to the radium dial, which glowed in the 
dark. Decay was taking place, and light was being produced.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The men 
argued that this was merely release of potential energy held in unstable 
electron levels. But there was growing confusion; Leavitt was making his point.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, 
they came to the granite. “This is alive, “Leavitt said. “It is living, 
breathing, walking, and talking. Only we cannot see it, because it is happening 
too slowly. This rock has a lifespan of three billion years. We have a lifespan 
of sixty or seventy years. We cannot see what is happening to this rock for the 
same reason that we cannot make out the tune on a record being played at the 
rate of one revolution every century. And the rock, for its part, is not even 
aware of our existence because we are alive for only a brief instant of its 
lifespan. To it, we are flashes in the dark…”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His point 
was clear enough, and they revised their thinking in one important respect. They 
conceded that it was possible that they may not be able to analyze certain life 
forms. It was possible that they may not be able to make the slightest headway, 
the least beginning, in such an analysis. They may stumble upon a form of life, 
so rare, so different, that they may not even recognize it as being alive.”</span></p>
