<p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Biology Focus Questions (BFQ): Chapter 
12: Read the assigned chapter sections and then answer the Q's in your 
notebook/journal. Note later sections are located below.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">12.1</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1. Summarize the relationship between genes and DNA.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">2. Describe, draw, and label the basic structure of DNA. 
(What is meant by a double helix and anti-parallel? How many different types of 
DNA nucleotides exist? How are they different?)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">3. What did Griffith do? What did his experiments 
demonstrate?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">4. What did Avery do? What did his experiments demonstrate?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">5. What did the Hershey Chase experiment reveal?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">6. What did Chargaff, Franklin, Watson and Crick, and 
Gilbert contribute to our understanding of DNA?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">12.2</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1. Summarize the events of DNA replication AND draw and 
label the phases. (List the enzymes and their functions).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">2. What is the relationship between the DNA molecule and 
chromosome structure. What is the importance of histone proteins to chromatin in 
eukaryotic DNA?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">3. What is the relative shape and size difference between 
prokaryote and eukaryote DNA molecules?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">12.3</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1. How does RNA differ from DNA? </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">2. Draw both a RNA and DNA nucleotide; point out and label 
the differences.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">3. Name the 3 main types of RNA and their functions.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">4. Describe the difference between transcription in a 
prokaryote and a eukaryote. List and explain the functions of any structures and 
enzymes used during transcription. What is the purpose of a promoter?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">5. How is RNA edited? Why is it necessary to “edit” RNA?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">6. What is the “genetic code”? How many nucleotides are 
required to translate the “genetic code” into something meaningful?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">7. Summarize translation in words and diagrams. List and 
explain the functions of any structures and enzymes used during translation (codon, 
anticodon, etc.)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">8. What is the relationship between genes and proteins? 
Explain what Crick meant by “central dogma”.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">9. What would the following mRNA transcript translate to?&nbsp;
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">AUG-UUC-GAC-CGG-UGA</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">12.4</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1. Contrast gene mutations with chromosome mutations. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">2. Draw the different types of mutations.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">3. Name the different ways (causes) mutation can arise.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">12.5</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1. Describe the parts of a gene (operon) in a prokaryote.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">2. How are <i>lac</i> genes turned off in a prokaryote?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">3. How are eukaryotic genes turned off and on (regulated)?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">4. Why aren’t all genes available to be on or off all the 
time? </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">5. Relate gene regulation to development of an organism? (HOX 
genes and differentiation).</p>
