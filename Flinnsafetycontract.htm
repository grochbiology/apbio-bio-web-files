You will be doing many laboratory activities whichrequire the use of hazardous chemicals. Safety in the scienceclassroom is the #1 priority for students, teachers, and parents. Toensure a safe science classroom, a list of rules has been developedand provided to you in this student safety contract. These rules mustbe followed at all times. Two copies of the contract are provided.One copy must be signed by both you and a parent or guardian beforeyou can participate in the laboratory. The second copy is to be keptin your science notebook as a constant reminder of the safetyrules.</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><B>GeneralGuidelines</B></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">1.
