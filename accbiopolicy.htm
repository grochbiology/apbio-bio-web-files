<H3>Honors (Accelerated) Biology Course Description and Policies
2003/2004</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>COURSE DESCRIPTION</B>: This course is for the highest
achieving Freshman or Sophomore student who is considering taking
Advanced Placement Biology as a Junior or Senior. Each unit of study
will involve inquiry and or problem based laboratory exercises. There
will be one to two required independent research projects per
semester. One of these projects must be used to expand into a local,
regional, or state science fair project. Students will have access to
advanced laboratory techniques. Students will keep a research
journal, utilize technology in their lab reports. Students will be expected to
complete a summer assignment. This course will meet the U.C. and
C.S.U. laboratory science requirements. A grade of C or better is
needed to fulfill this requirement. This is NOT a weighted course, as
Universities do not recognize weighted courses for freshmen
students.</P>

<P>&nbsp;Students will study the major themes of biology utilizing a
variety of inquiry-based laboratories, and lessons. The major themes
include: Evolution: patterns and products of change; Interaction and
Interdependence; Genetic continuity and reproduction; Growth,
development, and differentiation; Energy, matter and organization;
Maintenance of a dynamic equilibrium; Science, technology and
society; Science as a process.</P>

<P>&nbsp;TEXTBOOK: <I>Biological Science: A Molecular Approach</I>,
BSCS Blue Version 8th</P>

<P>edition, 2000.</P>

<P>Suggested Supplemental Materials: SAT II Biology Preparation Guides. There

<P>Grades are posted approximately each two weeks. Grades are also

(you will need your student ID and a password that I will provide in class).</P>

<P>ASSIGNMENTS:</P>

<P>Homework: All homework is to be typed single spaced #10 font, and
corrected with a red ink pen during class discussions. It must be
clearly marked with the Chapter, Question (s) #, DUE DATE, and this
must be highlighted. All graded/recorded/returned assignments are to
be kept in the student binder. All assignments are due on the date
assigned. You are allowed one 'oops' late assignment per semester.
Any 'oops' assignments are due as soon as possible and no later than
the unit test.</P>

<P>Labs: Lab notes, diagrams, and data are to be written in the lab
journal in pencil. Begin a new page for each lab.&nbsp; Lab title and date must be written and
highlighted on the first line of the page. Lab procedure packets are
to be kept in the binder in a special section.</P>

<P>Post lab analysis/questions are to be typed, unless a specific
handout is assigned w/ spaces to fill in the answers. All lab
abstracts and lab reports are to be typed single space, #10 font.</P>

<P>Journal Entries: Entries include all class notes, daily questions
and video notes. Topic (e.g. Lecture: photosynthesis), and date must
be written at the top of the page and highlighted. Begin a new page
in your journal when a new topic is introduced.</P>

<P><U>Absences and Tardiness:</U> Only those with legal absences have
the right to make-up work for credit. You have three days by district
policy to make up missed assignments, or by arrangement, please see
me if you need to make these arrangements. . <U>It is the
responsibility of the student to check the calendar for missed
assignments, pick up any handouts, seek clarification if confused and
to make up missed laboratory work, tests and quizzes at lunch or
after school by arrangement within one week or no credit will be
given</U>.</P>

<P>Tardiness is a disruption. Excessive tardiness* will lead to class
or school detention. Three illegal absences* may cause you to be
dropped from this course. See student handbook for details. (* See
Academic Responsibility and Accountability section).(<a
  href="http://www.srvhs.org/academics/classes/science/bio/bio_home_page/bioacadresp.htm">Academic
  Responsibility Information</a>)</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS"><U>Academic
Responsibility/Cheating Policy</U>: Please read the student guide for
specific consequences. Cheating, which includes plagiarism, is
defined as representing any work that is not your own original work
as your work. This includes using another student's work from a
previous year, this year, looking at another student's test, work
copied and pasted from the internet or other published material, etc.
<u>All work turned in must be in your own words. There are no joint
assignments. You may consult with other students, but your work must
be original.</u> </FONT></P>

<P><U>Daily Class Procedures</U>: Class starts when the bell rings.
Your homework must be turned in before the bell, (if called for on
the board or overhead at the beginning of class) or it will be
considered late, and only worth 50% of the total possible points.
Always check the front board for daily instructions, homework
assignments and activities.</P>

<P>Extra Credit: Extra credit may be offered periodically during the
semester. These opportunities will be
announced in class and generally posted in the classroom. Extra
credit  points cannot exceed 3% of
the total possible points.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Success Tips:</P>

<P>1. Attend class daily. Turn in all work on time, neat and
legible.</P>

<P>2. Take pride in your work. Make every effort to do all of the
assignments, especially for days you have missed. Even though you
receive reduced points for late work you are still responsible for
the subject matter covered. It will help you on the Final exam in the
long run.</P>

<P>3. Participate in class discussions: ask questions; take notes;
get notes when absent.</P>

<P>4. Maintain communication with your teacher by phone, fax or
e-mail.</P>

<P>5. Cooperate and participate during labs. You will be expected to
know how to use equipment and how to do certain procedures.</P>

<P>6. Review for quizzes and tests.</P>
