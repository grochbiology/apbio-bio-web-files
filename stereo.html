<B><FONT SIZE=+1>1.	Geometric isomerism.</FONT></B>  The rotation around a C-C double bond is strongly hindered due to the presence of a large barrier (~70 kcal/mol) associated with a need to break a 
<IMG SRC="pi.GIF" width="11" height="9"> bond.  This leads to existence of (<I>achiral</I>) geometric isomers with a different arrangement of substituents around a double bond.  These differ in both physical properties (hence they are separable) and some chemical properties.  For the geometric isomerism to exist, <B>each</B> carbon <B>must</B> bear two different substituents.<P>


<B><FONT SIZE=+1>2.	Classification of geometric isomers.</FONT></B>  If the <I>total</I>  number of different substituents on a double bond is <B>2</B>, geometric isomers may be classified as <I>cis</I>- or<I> trans</I>-. <P>

	When the <I>total</I>  number of substituents is <B>3 or 4</B>, the isomers are classified as <B>E or Z</B> by assigning the<I> order of priority</I> of subsituents at each carbon of the double bond and giving an E designation to an alkene with the <B>high priority substituents in a <I>trans</I>- configuration</B>.<P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1>3.	Conformational isomerism</FONT></B>.  Rotation around each C-C bond in acyclic alkanes is relatively free and is represented by means of a torsional strain energy diagram. Such a diagram shows extrema corresponding to limiting conformations (stable conformations - valleys, unstable (TS) - cols).<P>

	<DD>a. <B> CONFIGURATIONAL ISOMERS (STEREOISOMERS)</B>: Molecules possessing <B>stereogenic centers</B> (see part f), atoms with <I>different spatial orientation</I> of substituent groups.  Molecules that have <I>n</I> stereogenic centers will <B>in general</B> have 2<SUP>n</SUP> stereoisomers, existing as (2<SUP>n</SUP>/2) pairs of enantiomers. This will be true provided that there are no <I>internal elements of symmetry</I> in the molecule. In that case the number of stereoisomers will be <B>reduced</B> because of the presence of <I>meso</I> stereoisomers (see part i below).<P>
<P>
<DD>	b.  <B>PLANE POLARIZED LIGHT</B> : Beam of light consisting of a EM wave vibrating in a single plane.<P>
<P>
	<DD>c. <B> SPECIFIC ROTATION</B> : Rotation of plane polarized light (in angular units) by the solution of a compound (or mixture of compounds) at<I> 1g/mL in a 1 dm (10 cm)</I> long cell.  The sense of rotation is indicated by either<B> (+)</B> (<I>dextrotatory (d)</I>, rotation to the right) or <B>(-)</B> (<I>levorotatory (l)</I>, rotation to the left).  Keep in mind that there is <B>no relationship</B> between the <I>absolute</I> stereochemistry and the <I>sense of rotation</I> of the plane polarized light, i.e. you <B>can't predict</B> R or S asignment (section <B>5</B> below) from <I>d</I> or <I>l</I> sense of rotation and vice-versa.<P>

	<DD>d. <B> OPTICAL PURITY</B> : The ratio of observed rotation of an <I>enantiomeric mixture</I> to the specific rotation of the <B>predominant enantiomer</B>.  Note that "optical purity" refers to optical purity of the<B> predominant</B> enantiomer.<P>
<P>
	<DD>e. <B> CHIRAL MOLECULES</B> : Molecules with a <I>non-superimposable mirror image</I> capable of being <B>optically active</B>, i.e able to rotate plane-polarized light (see parts <B>b</B> and <B>c</B> above).  They may or may not contain stereogenic atoms.  Keep in mind that that if a molecule contains one stereogenic carbon it is authomaticaly chiral and exists as a pair of <B>enantiomers</B> (see part d below). However, molecule with <B>more than one</B> stereogenic carbons may have <I>meso</I> stereoisomers that are <B>not chiral</B>.<P>
<P>
	 <DD>f.  <B>STEREOGENIC CENTERS (ATOMS)</B> : sp<SUP>3</SUP> carbons (or other non-C atoms) with <B>four different groups</B> attached.<P>
<P>
<DD>	g. <B> ENANTIOMERS</B> : A pair of stereoisomers that are <I>non-superimposable mirror images</I>.  They possess <B>identical physical properties</B><I> except for the sense of rotation of plane polarized light</I>.  Enantiomers <B>can't be separated, only resolved</B> by use of optically pure chiral reagent (see Section 6 here).  They possess <B>identical chemical reactivity</B> unless the reaction involves the use of  a <I>chiral material</I> (solvent, reagent or catalysts).<P>

	<DD>h. <B> DIASTEREOMERS</B> : A pair of stereoisomers that are <I>non-superimposable non-mirror images</I>.  They possess <B>different physical properties and can be separated</B>.  Unlike enantiomers diastereomers <B>do not occur in pairs</B>.  This means that one can only sat that the molecule with <I>n</I> stereogenic centers and no internal symmetry elements will exist as (2<SUP>n</SUP>/2) pairs of enantiomers, but one can not specify the number of diastereomers since <B>any one of the enantiomers in any one of the pairs</B> is a diastereomer of <B>all other stereoisomers</B> except it's enantiomer partner.<P>
<P>
	<DD> i. <B> MESO COMPOUNDS</B> : Molecules that <B>contain more than one stereofenic center</B> but also <I>possess internal elements of symmetry</I> making one half of the molecule an enantiomer of the other half.  They are <I>superimposable</I> on their mirror image and are consequently <I>achiral</I>, i.e. they are the <B>same molecule</B> as their enantiomer.  Note that they are only related to other stereoisomers as <B>diastereomers</B>.<P>
<P>
	 <DD>j. <B> RACEMIC MODIFICATION (MIXTURE)</B> : An <B>optically inactive</B> 1:1 mixture of enantiomers.<P>
<P>
	 <DD>k. <B> CONFORMATIONAL ENANTIOMERS</B> : Enantiomers that are <I>interconvertable by internal inversion or by rotation around C-C bond</I> when the barrier to these processes is <B>low</B>.  Usually they are achiral but may become chiral, i.e. non-interconvertable, at <B>low temperatures</B>.<P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1>6. 	Resolution of a racemic mixture.</FONT></B>  Reaction of a pair of enantiomers gives a pair of products that are diastereomeric.  This reaction also may not break bonds to the chiral center.<P>
<I>	Example</I> :  Resolution of a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric acids by a pure enantiomer of a chiral organic amine.  In this case the products are a pair of diastereomeric salts that are separable by the difference in their solubility in water.<P>
