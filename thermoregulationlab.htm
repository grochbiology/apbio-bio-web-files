<p><font size="4">*(NOTE: do not participate in this lab activity if you have a
<u><a href="http://www.wdxcyber.com/ngen22.htm">known allergy to shellfish or iodine</a></u>, please bring a parent note excusing 
you from participating in this lab. Complete the pre-lab questions in your 
journal and record your lab mates data to help you answer the post-lab 
questions.)</font></p>
<p><u>Objectives:</u></p>
<p>Demonstrate&nbsp; sweat glands in skin.</p>
<p>Determine the sweat gland activity with a change of environmental temperature 
and body temperature.</p>
<p>Organizing data in tables.</p>
<p>Comparing effects of different experimental conditions.</p>
<p><u>Materials:</u></p>
<p>cotton balls, iodine, cotton swabs, 2 inch square copy paper, heat source, 
metric ruler</p>
<p>Background Questions:</p>
<p>1. What is homeostasis?</p>
<p>2. How is internal body temperature regulated in humans?</p>
<p>3. How does the internal body temperature of mammals and birds compare to 
that of reptiles and amphibians?</p>
<p>4. What are the sensory organs that communicate with the brain's temperature 
control center in the hypothalamus?</p>
<p>5. Write your own question in your journal.</p>
<p><u>Procedure:</u></p>
<p>1. Pick one area on your body where sweating occurs rapidly when you get 
nervous or too warm. (palm)</p>
<p>2. Swab the area with a cotton ball saturated with alcohol. Allow to dry 
completely.</p>
<p>3. Swab the dry area with the diluted iodine, allow to dry completely.</p>
<p>4. For each condition (no stimulus-control, heat (light bulb)&nbsp; and 
exercise, allow (0 time, 5 minutes and 5 minutes) the appropriate time to pass 
before applying the paper to the area. Hold the paper still for 30 seconds, 
pressing firmly without moving the paper. Examine the paper for faint blue/black 
dots. Draw a 1 cm square and count the number of dots. Record in your data 
table.</p>
<p>5. Clean off the area with more alcohol to remove iodine.</p>

<p>Post Lab Questions:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Where do you hypothesize that the greatest number of sweat glands 
are located: on the back of hand or forearm or on the forehead?</p>
<p>2. What do the dots on the paper represent?</p>
<p>3. Were there more dots on the paper before or after the heat exposure?</p>
<p>4. What does sweating accomplish for the body?</p>
<p>5. How is sweating an adaptation&nbsp; that maintains homeostasis?</p>
<p>6. As you reacted to heat and exercise, what changes were observed in the 
sweat glands?</p>
<p>7. How do the sweat glands fit into the analogy of the body as a human 
thermostat?</p>
<p>8. Write a new question that could be explored as a new investigation.</p>
