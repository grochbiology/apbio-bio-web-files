<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><u>Title Page:</u> The title page bears the title of your

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><u>Abstract Page</u>: </b>Begin numbering the pages 
consecutively beginning with the abstract as page 1. Your research paper begins 
with an abstract<b>, however the abstract is written after</b> you’ve written 
the rest of the report sections. The abstract must not be greater than 250 words 
and it includes portions of the other report sections.&nbsp; So though it appears 
first in the report, it is written last. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Rules for writing abstracts:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Avoid use of pronouns (I, we, our, my…)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Write in past tense 3<sup>rd</sup> person style</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Single space, 10 font, indented</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">* THE FIRST sentence should restate the purpose of the 
experiment</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">* THE SECOND sentence should restate your hypothesis</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">* THE THIRD sentence should restate your null hypothesis</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">* THE FOURTH-FIFTH sentences summarize the procedure 
including how you established the control (this is NOT a list…use sentences)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">* THE SIXTH-EIGHTH sentences summarize the data, including 
the statistical analysis and error analysis (this is NOT data tables…use 
sentences to explain the findings)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">* THE NINTH-TENTH sentences summarize your conclusion being 
sure to mention whether the results supports the hypothesis or null hypothesis 
and reference your statistics here that support your conclusion.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><u> <b>QUESTION, PURPOSE, Hypothesis, AND&nbsp; Null hypothesis 
Page</b></u>:&nbsp; Your original testable question.&nbsp;The purpose of the 
project.&nbsp; The hypothesis 
is generally written in an “If…, then… format.&nbsp; The null hypothesis states that 
the variable will not have a measurable effect and the outcome is unrelated to 
the variable.&nbsp; <font size="3"><font color="#FF0000">Note: if your project 
is in the category of &quot;Engineering&quot; follow this link for the </font>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><u>Introduction/Research Rationale Page:</u>&nbsp; The 
introduction restates your clearly formulated and testable hypothesis as well as 
explanation of your idea, how you got it and why you think the work in 
interesting and important.&nbsp; Include what you hoped to achieve when you started 
the project.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><u>Variables Page:</u></b> <span class="BODYTEXT">These 
changing quantities are called <b>variables</b>, and an experiment usually has 
three kinds: independent, dependent, and controlled. The <b>independent variable</b> 
is the one that is changed by the scientist. In an experiment there is only one 
independent variable. As the scientist changes the independent variable, he or 
she <b>observes</b> what happens. The <b>dependent variable</b> changes in 
response to the change the scientist makes to the independent variable. The new 
value of the dependent variable is <i>caused</i> by and <i>depends</i> on the 
value of the independent variable.&nbsp; The number of dependent variables in an 
experiment varies, but there is often more than one. Experiments also have <b>
controlled variables</b>. Controlled variables are quantities that a scientist 
wants to remain constant, and he must observe them as carefully as the dependent 
variables.&nbsp; Some people refer to controlled variables as &quot;constant 
variables.&quot; </p>
</span>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><u>Review of Literature</u></b> (5-15 pages) This section of 
your paper is your report to the readers of work and research conducted by 
others in the past that relates to your topic and facts that help introduce the 
readers to the topic. Without a minimum of two previous studies related to your 
project, the literature review is worthless!!&nbsp; More is better.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><u>Research Materials and Procedure Pages(s)</u>:&nbsp; List the 
materials that you used. Then explain step-by-step what you did in your 
experimentation. If drawings will make it clearer, draw them on separate pages 
and include them in this section. Explain any materials that you constructed in 
detail.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><u>Discussion Page(s)</u>:&nbsp;</b> Explain the exact process by 
which you reached your conclusions after comparing the control and experimental 
variables. Look at your graphs and data tables before you write this section.&nbsp; 
This section should flow logically so that the reader can easily follow your 
train of thought.&nbsp; Compare your data with the null hypothesis, what you would 
have expected if the observations you made were completely unrelated to the 
effect you were expecting, or to your hypothesis, the predicted results.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><u><span style="text-decoration:none">&nbsp;</span></u></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><u>Conclusions Page</u>:&nbsp; Work out your statistical 
analysis before you write this section. &nbsp;Summarize your results referring to 
your statistical and error analysis. Be sure to mention whether the results 
support the hypothesis or null hypothesis.&nbsp; &nbsp;MAKE SURE YOU DO NOT INTRODUCE 
ANYTHING THAT WAS NOT ALREADY MENTIONED IN THE PREVIOUS PARTS OF YOUR PAPER. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><u>Recommendations Page(s):</u> </b>Describe what you 
would do differently if you were to do this project again and any future 
experiments you'd like to do on this topic to further your investigation.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><u>Acknowledgments Page(s)</u>:&nbsp; Give credit to everyone 
who assisted you.&nbsp; This may include businesses, individuals, educational or 
research intuitions.&nbsp; Identify any financial support or material donations you 
may have received.</p>

citation machine</a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><u>Data Tables:</u> &nbsp;Data from an experiment must always be 
presented in a form that allows the results to be readily communicated to other 
scientists.&nbsp; Give each Table a number and a descriptive title and all columns 
are labeled with units of measure.&nbsp; The independent variable (or variables) is 
placed on the left.&nbsp; The dependent variable (or variables) should be placed to 
the right.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><u>Graphs</u>: Always use an accurate title for the graph.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;If you don’t know how to make graphs on the computer using Excel, then be sure 
to use graph paper to plot the points accurately.&nbsp; Always record the independent 
variable on the X- (horizontal) axis and the dependent variable on the 
Y-(vertical ) axis.&nbsp; Space intervals evenly along each axis, and plot data 
points only at coordinates where data were collected.&nbsp; Set the maximum values on 
both axes slightly above the maximum values of the data.&nbsp; The data should never 
extend over most of the graph’s area.&nbsp; </p>

your analysis of data on the following

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><u>Error Analysis:</u></b> Students often assume that each 
measurement that they make in the laboratory is true and accurate.&nbsp; Likewise, 
they often assume that the values that they derive through experimentation are 
very accurate.&nbsp; &nbsp; However, sources of error often prevent students from being as 
accurate as they would like.&nbsp; Percent error calculations are used to determine 
how close to the true values, or how accurate, their experimental values really 
are. Examples for representing your error analysis of data on the following
