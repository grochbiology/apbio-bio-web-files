Course Objective: <br>
To encourage the development of scientifically literate students who enjoy
learning biology, who are confident in the laboratory, and who are ready to
meet the future challenge of college-level science coursework. Students are
prepared and urged to take the AP Biology Exam in May.&nbsp; Since many
colleges and universities do not give credit for the College Board exam, and
students must pay for their exams, we cannot require students to sit for the
exam.<br>
.<br>
<br>Course Description.</p><p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"> Every effort is made to insure that students are knowledgeable and develop mastery of the 4 big ideas:<br>a)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; evolution drives the diversity and unity of life,<br>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp; biological use of free energy and molecular building blocks to
grow, to reproduce, and to maintain dynamic homeostasis,<br>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp; living systems store, retrieve, transmit and respond to the
information essential to life processes, and biological systems
interact, and<br>d)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; these systems and their interactions possess complex properties. <br>This
course is also designed to cover the assigned topics which include
biochemistry, cell structure and function, metabolism, genetics,
molecular basis of inheritance, DNA technology, evolution,
microbiology, classification, plants, animals, animal physiology, and
ecology. The course has been redesigned to increase depth of knowledge
downplaying past breath requirements. Over 25% of this course is
devoted to laboratory experience which includes few teacher
demonstrations, some traditional hands-on, guided laboratory activities
as well as a minimum of 8 student designed laboratory exercises as
required by the College Board. Also included are supplementary hands-on
laboratory investigations not covered by the suggested labs, and
expanded laboratory experiences in inquiry-based activities to augment
the use of scientific method, problem solving, and high level thinking,
formulating hypotheses, and designing testable questions. This course
is open to all students that have completed college prep biology;
completion or con-current enrollment in chemistry is recommended.<br></p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Syllabus (Page 1)<br>Unit

write-ups range from summaries of the activities, problem solving
(examples include: Chi Square, Q10, Punnett Squares, cladograms),
formal lab write-ups (see below for requirements), and several
practicum-based laboratory tests. Students are expected to gain
knowledge in technical writing, statistical analysis of lab data,
presentation of data in appropriate graphical format, discussion of
results, and analysis of data to form inferences from data in both
written and oral presentations.<br>(Semi-Formal laboratory write-ups are usually modified from the formal requirements)<br>Title:
The title is a statement (not a question) reflecting the independent
and dependent variables. Example: The Effect of Various Concentrations
of Sucrose on Carrot Slices.<br>Abstract: 4-8 sentences. Includes 1-2
sentences of introductory information, 1-2 sentences regarding the
purpose/hypothesis of the activity, 1-2 sentences regarding the result
trends and 1-2 sentences regarding the analysis/conclusions of the
activity.<br>Introduction: 1-2 paragraphs. The introduction/ background
includes prior knowledge and important information regarding the
activity. Also includes explanation of the key concepts and/or
vocabulary. Make sure references used are credited in the following
format. (Author's Last Name, Date of publication). Also make sure the
full reference is found in the references section.<br>Hypotheses,
Variables and Control. Please use the "if...then...because" format for
the null and regular hypotheses. Make sure the independent, dependent
and standardized variables are sentences. Also make sure the control
includes an explanation of "why" this is a control for the experiment. <br>Materials/Methods/Procedure: Briefly describe in a paragraph what materials, methods and procedure used in the activity.<br>Results/Trends:
Data tables and graphs must have&nbsp; descriptive titles, see the
title section for information. The data tables must be computer
generated with appropriate reference to the units of the measurements
taken during the activity. The graphs must be computer generated with
both axes labeled and if more than one line is shown, a key must be
provided. Include statistical calculations (ex. Chi Square, Means, Q10,
etc.) The third requirement is a trend/results paragraph, describing in
words the graph and/or data table contents.<br>Analysis/Conclusion/Lab
Review Questions: In general the requirements of this section of the
report are to provide an explanation of "why" of the results/data
section supports or doesn't support any hypotheses. Use appropriate
statistics to support inferences that can be drawn from data
collected.&nbsp; What information in the data section and the
introduction help explain the results found? This might include the
answers to the questions at the end of an activity.<br>References: (2 minimum) Use APA format<br>Other Curricular Activities:<br>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Optional: Summer Assignment: Ecology Unit Reading<br>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Extra Credit: Summer Reading Book Review<br>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;Research Article Reviews: using primary research articles from
Nature or Science or other acceptable research journal. (Required
topics: photosynthesis, genes, evolution mechanisms, bioethics, extra
credit topics: cell reproduction, and prokaryotes).<br>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;Speakers: ranging from returning students talking about
undergraduate research, professors from nearby universities, emergency
