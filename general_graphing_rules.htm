<p>General Graphing Rules: </p>
<p>On paper: </p>
<ol>
  <li>Use a ruler for each Axis </li>
  <li>Title must be appropriate and show a relationship between variables. 
  (Example: The Effect of (Independent Variable) on (Dependent Variable)... The 
  Effect of Sunlight on Freckles...</li>
  <li>Both X and Y axis must be labeled with the unit of measurement and the 
  actual units. (X axis reflects the independent variable and the Y axis shows 
  what changes have occurred during the experiments... the dependent variable) &gt; 
  Examples: Height (cm), Time (sec).</li>
  <li>Graph should be as large as possible for accuracy. </li>
  <li>Use a Point of origin that&nbsp; makes sense. You do not always start a 
  (0,0).</li>
  <li>Units are represented in even increments per axis. Example&nbsp; if you 
  are observing days for a short period of time on the X axis use increments of 
  one, or fives or tens etc... increments generally do not change on the axes.
  </li>
  <li>Do not connect the points on a line graph, unless specifically directed to 
  do so. Line up your ruler so that half of the points are on either side of the 
  ruler to make a best fit or trend line. </li>
  <li>If needed use a color code or key and label for multiple lines. </li>
