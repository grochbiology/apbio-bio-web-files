<p><font size="-1">&quot;One of the most remarkable events in the annals of 
anthropology occurred (over) 20 years ago in an area of northern Tanzania called 
Laetoli. A team lead by famed archaeologist Mary D. Leakey was searching for 
fossils of early hominids that ranged through East Africa&nbsp;&nbsp; millions 
of years ago. In the summer of 1976, after a long day in the field, three 
visitors to Leakey's camp engaged in some horseplay tossing chucks of dried 
elephant dung ant one another. When paleontologist Andrew Hill dropped to the 
ground to avoid being hit, he noticed what seemed to be animal tracks in a layer 
of exposed tuff- a sedimentary rock created by deposits of volcanic ash. On 
closer inspection of the area, the scientists found thousands of fossilized 
tracks, including the footprints of elephants giraffes, rhinoceroses, and 
several extinct mammal species. But the most extraordinary find came two years 
later, when Paul I. Abell, a geochemist who had joined Leakey's team found what 
appeared to be a human footprint at the edge of a gully eroded by the Ngarusi 
River. excavations of the Footprint Tuff, as it came to be known, in 1978 and 
1979 revealed two parallel trails of hominid footprints extending some 27 meters 
(89 feet). the volcanic sediments were dated radiometrically to be between 3.4 
million and 3.8 million years old.&quot; (Agnew, Neville and Demas. <u>Scientific 
American</u>. :Preserving the Laetoli Footprints.&quot; September 1998. P. 45-66.)</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="-1">Objective:&nbsp; How do we determine the height of hominids 
based on foot length?</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">Procedure:</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">1.&nbsp; Look at the Northern and Southern sections of the 
Laetoli trackway. Create a hypothesis (in your journal) about who could have 
left those footprints. Be as descriptive as possible (i.e. what type of organism 
make the footprints, what were they doing, and how old are these organisms?)</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">2. Inspect the G1-27 and G1-33 footprints. How could you 
determine the height of these organisms? How could you determine how the 
footprints were made? (Did you notice that one of the footprints is actually a 
left foot, check out the southern portion of the trackway?)</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">3. In order to answer the previous two questions, develop a 
hypothesis and procedure to test your hypothesis in class, then:</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">a) measure each footprint, using your lengthy relationship 
data, determine the height of the person.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">b) measure the stride distance for the G1 person on the 
trackway, take several measurements and determine the mean, then convert the 
mean from the scaled down trackway to the actual stride distance using the scale 
information on the trackway. Determine your height from the lengthy relationship 
graph you made earlier. (Note 44.5 mm of trackway is equal to 1 meter actual 
distance; take the scale measurement divide by 44.5 and the value will be a 
decimal which multiplied by 100 is in cm).</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">c) measure the plaster cast footprints of the female and male 
students (use the walking plaster cast); determine your height from the lengthy 
relationship graph you made earlier.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">d) make a sand print of&nbsp; your footprint in the moist 
sand in the classroom, measure your footprint in cm and determine your height 
from the lengthy relationship graph you made earlier.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">4. Create a data table for your experiment and record class 
data (in centimeters).</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">5. NOTE: the actual height of the male plaster cast footprint 
is 6' 6&quot;, the female is 5' 2&quot; (convert the height to inches and then multiple by 
2.54 to convert to cm). The actual height of <i>A. afarensis </i>is between 1.0 
-1.3 meters. (remember that 100 cm = 1 meter).</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">Post Lab Questions:</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">1 Determine the percent error for the plaster cast height 
(get correct height from teacher). Use the formula below; (the absolute value of 
the actual height minus the estimated height divided by the actual height, then 
multiply by 100). Remember the actual heights are listed in procedure #5 and the 
estimated height is determined by using the graphs made in the lengthy 
relationship activity.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<font face="Times New Roman">|<u>actual height-estimated height</u>| / actual 
height x 100 = % error</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="-1">2. Taking into consideration the % 
error above, calculate the height range for the organism that made the G1-27 and 
G1-33 footprints.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="-1">3. What factors could have influenced 
the quality of the footprints?</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="-1">4. Write a short story describing how 
the footprints were originally made? Include any information that you know about 
the area and time period. Be creative, make a comic strip, poem, jingle, etc.</font></p>
