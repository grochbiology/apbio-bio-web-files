<p>Biology Policy and Lab Donation Signature Sheet. Please return to Mrs. Groch 
ASAP</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">Dear Parents or Guardians:&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">You can find the main web page by going to
<a href="http://www.srvhs.org/" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">
http://www.srvhs.org</a> ; under “Staff/Faculty” select “Science”; then find 
“Biology Web Page” to the right of my name. The direct link to the main web page 
is located at:

<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">Please click on your student's class either 
&quot;CP Biology&quot; or “Accelerated Biology.” There you will find the course policy, 
syllabus, homework calendar with tutorial links and study tips. You can also 
find the link to web grade access or use this direct link

<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">We, the Science teachers at San Ramon Valley High 
School, are committed to providing your son or daughter with the best science 
education available.&nbsp; Due to the continued lack of funding for education from 
the State , we are restricted by what we can accomplish. The money the science 
department is allocated by the State and school district is just over $3 per 
student for the entire school year.&nbsp;&nbsp; For this reason we must ask for your 
support by making a donation to the SRVHS Science Department.&nbsp; This donation will help 
maintain the quality of our laboratory courses, demonstrations, provide 
supplies, chemicals and specimens, repair equipment, maintain high safety 
standards, and allow us to upgrade equipment.&nbsp; We would like to thank you in 
advance for your continued and generous support.&nbsp; It is warmly appreciated.&nbsp; 
Without your donations, our laboratory science program would come to a complete 
halt, as your donation is our only adequate means of laboratory funds.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
cost of science materials continues to rise each year, while our allotment of 
funds remains stagnant.&nbsp; The amount of State/District dollars barely covers the cost of 
our paper products for the nearly 1600+ students enrolled in science classes every day 
of the school year. &nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">We would like to recommend a minimum </font>
<b><font size="2">lab donation of&nbsp; </font></b>
<o:p>
<font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS"> <b>$40.00&nbsp;</b></font></o:p><font size="2">per student for the school year.&nbsp;&nbsp; We will also accept donations 
of supplies such as: office supplies; scientific equipment, such as microscopes, 
balances, glassware, are always welcome donations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year I 
am starting to ask for computer donations; the iMacs are aging quickly 
(keyboards, mice and batteries to name a few) and with the demise of the state 
program for technology there is no funding to replace or repair these computers. 
If you are interested please check out the district requirements for donated 
machines. The district link is:&nbsp; </font>
