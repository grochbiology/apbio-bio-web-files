<p><b><font size="4">Anatomy and Physiology of Animal Systems Project 
Presentations</font></b>: (note check calendar for presentation dates... note 
State Testing may move some dates). (See Rubric on this page)</p>
<p><u>Topics</u>:&nbsp; Digestion; Nutrition; Circulation; Respiration; 
Thermoregulation; Excretion; Immune; Endocrine;&nbsp; Movement 
(skeletal/muscle); Nervous; Sensory; Reproduction; Development (14 topics must 
be covered; some categories are eligible for more than one person presentations)</p>
<p><b><font size="4">Requirements:</font></b></p>
<p>1.&nbsp; A summary lecture sheet with additional materials developed by you, 
copying the lecture from your CD is not acceptable. Must be emailed to the class 
(this activity is meant to be &quot;green&quot;.)</p>
<p>2. Development of a PowerPoint presentation which needs to include; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. diagrams (make sure you cite the source of all 
&quot;borrowed&quot; pictures and animations within the presentation and have a 
Bibliography at the end using APA format).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. simple backgrounds with contrasting text (not visually 
confusing), avoid flashy transitions which can be visually distracting as well 
as confusing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. NO more than 5 bulleted points per slide</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. NO reading verbatim from the slide show, practice and 
be prepared to just use the bulleted points as prompts for your presentation 
(note cards are permitted.... but again reading is unprofessional and you risk 
boring your audience who will also be providing part of your grade).</p>
<p>3. You may swap presentation dates with my permission and the consent of the 
other party.</p>
<p><b><font size="4">Rubric (100 points) (<font color="#FF0000">Warning taking 
someone else's lecture material off the internet without proper citation is 
PLAGIARISM will result in a ZERO on this assignment</font>)</font></b></p>
<p>20 points: Class evaluation of presentation (Students will keep ONE sheet to 
turn in with evaluations of all presentation (other than your own of course).</p>
<p>50 points: Slide show quality (proper citations, clear, simple slides, no 
more than 5 bulleted points per slide; presentation between 20 and 30 minutes; 
emailed summary lecture sheet to class by the day of the lecture (-5 points if 
late).</p>
<p>30 points: Teacher evaluation of presentation (able to field questions from 
audience; if more than 1 presenter all members present equally, prepared and NOT 
reading directly from PowerPoint and/or note cards- okay to reference cards and 
slide show), not disruptive during other presentations) </p>
