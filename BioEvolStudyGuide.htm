<P>Evolution Unit Test Study Guide</P>
<P>1. Darwin's voyage, observations</P>
<P>2. Other scientists who influenced&nbsp; Darwin (Hutton, Lyell,
Mathus, Lamarck)</P>
<P>3. Major differences between Lamarck and Darwin's theories of
evolution.</P>
<P>4. Definitions of inheritance of natural variations, inheritance
of acquired characteristics, natural selection, survival of the
fittest.</P>
<P>5. Why did Darwin finally decide to publish &quot; On Origin of
Species&quot;?</P>
<P>6. What is the difference between natural and artificial
selection?</P>
<P>7. Why do individual's with the best adaptations survive?</P>
<P>8. What is an adaptation (in evolutionary terms)?</P>
<P>9. What is a vestigial structure? What are some examples used in
the textbook?</P>
<P>10. Why would different organisms have similar looking larvae?</P>
<P>11. How was the fossil record important to Darwin?</P>
<P>12. How are members of a population similar, what do they all have
in common?</P>
<P>13. What is in a &quot;gene pool&quot;; how is it related to
alleles and populations? How do alleles change?</P>
<P>14. What do all the frequencies of an allele equal?</P>
<P>15. What are all the ways that frequencies of alleles can change?
What are the two main sources of genetic variation?</P>
<P>16. What is the genetic outcome of sexual reproduction? What is a
change in DNA sequence called?</P>
<P>17. What is the relationship between a trait with two alleles and
phenotypes? Define a polygenic trait.</P>
<P>18. According to Darwin, natural selection acts directly on ____.</P>
<P>19. What is a vestigial structure? Name an example.</P>
<P>20. What are the three modes of natural selection (hint: bell
curves).</P>
<P>21. Define genetic drift, bottleneck event, and founder's effect.</P>
<P>22. What are the characteristics of genetic equilibrium? What can
disturb genetic equilibrium? 
</P>
<P>23. Describe all the types of isolating mechanisms that drive
speciation.</P>
<P>24. Which isolating mechanism generally indicates a new species
has formed out of an existing population?</P>
<P>25. What kinds of inferences did Darwin draw from the Galapagos
Finches?</P>
<P>26. What is the composition of sedimentary rock? What is an index
fossil; how is it useful? How do scientists compare relative ages of
fossils?</P>
<P>27. What is the difference between relative and absolute dating of
fossils? What is radiodating? what is an index fossil?</P>
<P>28. How do hominids differ from other primates? What are the major
characteristics of a biped?</P>
<P>29. What are some major characteristics of <I>Australopitecus
afarensis, Homo Habilis, Homo ergaster, Homo erectus, Homo (sapiens)
neanderthalensis, and Homo (sapiens) sapiens? </I>&nbsp;(relative
dates, key anatomical features, etc.)</P>
<P>30. How did the horse change over time; what key anatomical
changes?</P>
<P>31. What is the cost of selective breeding and farmers and
ranchers only using a few breeds of an organism for food?</P>
<P>32. Which would result in faster speciation, geographic isolation
or living within the same ecosystem? Explain.</P>
<P>33. Compare (similarities and differences) between the anatomical
features of a bipedal primate and a non-bipedal primate.</P>
