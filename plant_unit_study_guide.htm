<p>Plant Unit Study Guide</p>
<p>Reading Ch 22-1, Ch 23-1, 23-4 and 23-5, Ch 25, journal notes on plant 
specimens</p>
<p>22 multiple choice, 1 drawing and 10 plant identifications (either Phylum, 
type (gymnosperm, angiosperm, monocot, dicot) or common name)</p>
<p>1. Define a plant.</p>
<p>2. Why do plants need light?</p>
<p>3. What are the characteristics of Bryophytes? What do they need that the 
seed plants do not to reproduce?</p>
<p>4. What is are the components of vascular tissue? What are the functions of 
each component?</p>
<p>5. How are seed-bearing plants different from the other types of plants?</p>
<p>6. Compare and contrast an angiosperm monocot from an angiosperm dicot. 
(petal numbers, seed part numbers, etc)</p>
<p>7. What are the major parts of a seed plant?</p>
<p>8. What are the structures you would find in a cross-section of a dicot leaf? 
What are the functions of each structure? Be able to identify all the different 
parts of the cross-section of a leaf.</p>
<p>9. Why are stomata necessary?</p>
<p>10. What is the function of auxin, ethylene gas, gibberellin in a plant's 
life?</p>
<p>11. Name four types of tropisms. What are the purposes of these tropisms and 
how do they help plants?</p>
<p>12. What is dormancy?</p>
<p>13. Where do angiosperms produce their seeds?</p>
<p>14. Which chemicals do plants use tor espond to changes in their environment?</p>
<p>15. Which substances produced in one part of a plant affect another part of 
the plant?</p>
<p>16. Which group of plants first colonized the Earth's surface? Second? Third? 
Fourth?</p>
<p>17. Know the structure of a dicot leaf.</p>
<p>18. Study the specimens that you looked at in the lab. Know their Division/Phylum, 
type/class (gymnosperm, angiosperm (monocot or dicot) and common name).<o:p><o:p><font size="2"><b><o:p><o:p><o:p><o:p><o:p><a href="leaf_identification_lab_specimen.htm">Leaf Lab Specimen List</a></b></font></p>
