<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">1. In your body (somatic) cells, for any 
given gene, how many genes have you inherited and who have they come from?</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">2.&nbsp; In your gametes (sex cells),&nbsp; 
for any given gene, how many genes will you pass on to your child?</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">3.&nbsp; What are homologous chromosomes?&nbsp; 
How are they like a matching pair of socks?&nbsp; Explain.</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">4.&nbsp; If an animal has a total of 10 
chromosomes in each somatic cell, how many homologous pairs are in each somatic 
cell?</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">5.&nbsp; Look at Figure 11-14.&nbsp; 
There are 8 chromosomes (4 pairs of homologous chromosomes...how do you know 
this?).&nbsp; This cell would be a diploid cell.&nbsp; What would be the colors 
of chromosomes in one &quot;set&quot;?&nbsp; How do you know?</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">6.&nbsp; For Figure 11-4, what would a 
gamete look like (explain in terms of color of chromosomes); draw it using the 
correct colors.</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">7.&nbsp; What happens to the number of 
chromosomes in each cell during meiosis?&nbsp; How is this accomplished?&nbsp; 
What is this type of cell called: haploid or diploid?&nbsp; Why?</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">8.&nbsp;&nbsp; What is a tetrad?&nbsp; 
Draw it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">9.&nbsp; What is crossing over?&nbsp; 
Draw homologous chromosomes before and after crossing over.&nbsp; You will need 
to color the chromosomes two different colors.</font></p>

called?&nbsp; What would their offspring look like?</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">7.&nbsp; What did Mendel want to do?</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">8.&nbsp; How did he prevent self 
pollination?</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">9. What does cross pollination mean?&nbsp; 
How was this useful to Mendel?</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">10. What is a trait? </font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">11.&nbsp; What were the traits like in 
the pea plants that Mendel crossed?</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">12.&nbsp; What did Mendel call the 
original pair of plants?&nbsp; What did he call the offspring?</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">13.&nbsp; Why did he call the offspring 
hybrids (what does this mean?)?</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">14.&nbsp; When Mendel crossed two 
different P plants, what did the F1 look like?&nbsp; Was it a blend of the 
parents?&nbsp; Did they all look like one parent?&nbsp; Did some look like one 
parent and the others look like the other parent?</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">15.&nbsp; Based on his experiments, what 
was Mendel's first conclusion?</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">16.&nbsp; What is a gene?</font></p>

conclusion?&nbsp; What does this mean?</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">19.&nbsp; How can an organism exhibit a 
recessive trait?</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">20.&nbsp; The allele for short height is 
recessive.&nbsp; Look at Figure 11-4 and explain what is happening to the short 
allele in both the F1 and F2 generations.</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">21. When do alleles segregate from each 
other?</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">22.&nbsp; Read about &quot;Explaining the F1 
cross&quot; and look at Figure 11-5.&nbsp; Keeping in mind that tall height (T) is 
dominant to short height (t), rewrite/redraw Figure 11-5 using words instead of 
letters.&nbsp; For example, Tt has the dominant allele so this would be tall.</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">23.&nbsp; In Figure 11-5, each letter 
represents a gene.&nbsp; Why is there only one letter in each of the gametes?</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">24 Define probability, use an example.

alleles segregating into gametes?</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">2.&nbsp; What experiment did Mendel do 
that answered this question?</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">3.&nbsp; How did Mendel show that yellow 
and round peas were the dominant traits?</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">4.&nbsp; What are the genotypes for the 
F2 generation for a two factor cross?&nbsp; How would that genotype be 
described?</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">5.&nbsp; Describe all the phenotypes of 
the offspring in regards to pea color (yellow or green) and pea texture (smooth 
or wrinkled).&nbsp; Where there some that weren't like the parents (the F1 
parents)?</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">6. Look at Figure 11-10.&nbsp; Count the 
number of peas for each phenotype: yellow/smooth; yellow/wrinkled; green/smooth; 
green/wrinkled.</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">6a.&nbsp; One genotype for a 
yellow/smooth pea is RRYy.&nbsp; How would you describe this (you need to 
describe both)?</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">7.&nbsp; What showed that the alleles for 
pea color and texture sort segregate independently of each other?</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">8.&nbsp; So, define the principle of 
independent assortment.</font></p>

of an organism besides genes?</font></p>

<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Chpt 11.5</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">1. What does it mean to say that genes 
are linked together?&nbsp; Are they found on the same chromosomes or different?</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">2.&nbsp; How did Mendel miss gene 
linkage?</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">3.&nbsp; Explain how crossing over 
effects gene linkage?</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">4.&nbsp; What is a gene map?</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">5.&nbsp; Explain how crossing 
over/recombination frequency data can be used to make a gene map.</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">6.&nbsp; If two genes are on the same 
chromosome but are usually inherited independently of each other, what does this 
tell you about their relative locations on the chromosome?</font></p>
