P. Biology Formal Laboratory Write Up Procedure</H3><P>See the handout for more detailed instructions:</P><P>Labs are an important part of this course. Some labs will beexperimental and will involve hypothesis formation, setting upequipment, manipulation of variables, gathering data and developingconclusions. Other labs will be observation labs and will involvingobserving organisms or phenomena and drawing conclusions. Some labswill be of your own design.</P><P>Record your data in your journal notebook. You will be asked toread all laboratory exercises ahead of time and you will need tocomplete Parts 1-3 before being allowed to participate in a formallab exercise. There are approximately 12 formal labs during theschool year.</P><P>Labs will be graded on a scale of one to five. Five represents alab that meets and exceeds all requirements, Four represents a labthat just meets the requirements. Scores of three and below aremissing information, sloppy or messy and/or are incomplete.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><H4>Part 1: Abstract:</H4><P>Length: One paragraph</P><P>Briefly summarize your investigation and your results.</P><H4>Part 2: Introduction/Purpose/Hypothesis/Null Hypothesis/Variables(IV,SV,DV) and Control Setup</H4><P>Length: Several paragraphs</P><P>In your own words describe your prior knowledge (any backgroundmaterial), the purpose of this activity, the specific question youare trying to test and the hypotheses and variables.</P><H4>Part 3: Procedure</H4><P>Length: Two to four paragraphs</P><P>In your own words describe the experimental tests you used,organize the methods in a logical order; explain how the work wasdone and remember you cannot copy the lab instructions out of yourlab book.</P><H4>Part 4: Results/Observations/Data</H4><P>Length: Two to four paragraphs (not including graphs or datatables.)</P><P>In your own words describe the experimental results, i.e. what youobserved. If appropriate, use graphs or data tables tosummarize/organize your results. If calculations are required, showyour work clearly. Do not form conclusions, this is done in the nextsection. When using graphs, please use graph paper or a computergraphing program and, if appropriate, use best fit for all linegraphs. The class computer is available for those without access tographing programs. Free-hand graphs are unacceptable.</P><H4>Part 5: Analysis/ Conclusions</H4><P>Length: Two to four paragraphs</P><P>In your own words, answer the following questions. (Hint: manylabs contain questions that can help organize your conclusion.)Include any assigned questions.</P><P>(a) Does your purpose/hypothesis match your results? Make sure youreference these statements with your data and controls.</P><P>(b) If so, how? If not, why? Explain what lead to error, e.g.,misconceptions, fallacy, inaccuracies, etc. Be specific.</P><P>(c) Are there any mechanisms (other ways) of demonstrating thesame results?</P><H4>Part 6: Acknowledgements/References and Sources</H4><P>List the sources (bibliography) and the individuals involved.</P><H4>Semi- Formal Lab Write-ups:</H4><P>For semi-formal lab write-ups, which will be the predominent typeof lab report, you will most likely only be only asked to do parts1,2,4, and 5. Be sure to read all instructions carefully.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><A HREF="index.htm">Return to Home Page</A> <A HREF="index.htm"><IMGSRC="images/animated-frog-3.gif" WIDTH=68 HEIGHT=60 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTHX-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></A></P></BODY></HTML>
