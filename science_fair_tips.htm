<p>Science Fair Tips (for your project, your board, and your presentation) from 
a Science Fair Sweepstakes Winner (Farnoosh Nik-Ahd)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Tips for Your Project:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .5in">

</span></span>Most importantly: participate in the science fair because you want 
to. Don’t do it for your parents or for the credit. It is very apparent who 
really wants to be there and who is forced to be there. When you want to be 
there, the passion you feel towards your research is very visible, and this 
makes the experience much more worthwhile for both you and the judges. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .5in">

</span></span>Pick something that interests you, but don’t limit yourself to 
things you know about. My project last year was on a topic I knew nothing about, 
yet by the end of it, I had learned all about it and was ready to share my new 
knowledge with the judges. Unique topics are especially good, as long as they 
interest you.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-family: Wingdings">Ø<span style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>If at all possible, try to do your project at a lab. The quality 
of the project is the most important thing—projects with advanced science really 
stand out. For my project, I worked at Stanford University. However, I had to 
really work hard to be able to do so. I sent over 300 emails to researchers at 
Stanford, and of those 300, 3 of them responded with a “yes.” DON’T BE AFRAID TO 
ASK!!! The most important part of science is that you ask questions and 
challenge yourself, so challenge yourself to broaden your horizons and work with 
real scientists. You have to be persistent about this—be prepared to be 
rejected, but if you try hard enough, you’ll probably find what you’re looking 
for. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-family: Wingdings">Ø<span style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>When you work at a lab, your project will most likely be of a 
higher quality (since you will be working with professionals), and it is always 
good to be able to throw an impressive name in there. However, if this doesn’t 
work out, don’t worry. Ask your teacher/mentor if they know of an alternative, 
or try to think of an advanced project yourself.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-family: Wingdings">Ø<span style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>How do you find a lab? If you don’t have connections through your 
parents or a friend (as most people don’t), go online!!! Select a university or 
lab, and send emails to researchers. Tell them about yourself, your interests, 
and qualifications, and show how eager and dedicated you are about working with 
them. People love to see high school students getting involved, and if they can, 
they will probably try to help you out or guide you. I ended up at the lab I 
worked at last year because one of the researchers I emailed couldn’t have me at 
his lab, but he forwarded that email to one of his friends. His friend then 
offered me the internship. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Tips for Creating Your Board:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-family: Wingdings">Ø<span style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Use attractive colors to guide your viewers and make your board 
stand out (you can use colors in your headings, charts, etc.). Make sure your 
colors are not distracting though.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-family: Wingdings">Ø<span style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Don’t fill your board with useless pictures for the sake of 
“filling up” your board. Make sure everything that is on your display is 
relevant to your project and bears some significance to your presentation. A 
good use of pictures is to show an example, make things easier to understand, 
etc.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-family: Wingdings">Ø<span style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Your board doesn’t have to be fancy or expensive to win. The Grand 
Prize winner at the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair last year 
had a hand-made board. This shows that winners are selected based on quality of 
science, and NOT on aesthetics. However, make sure your display is pleasing and 
complements your project. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-family: Wingdings">Ø<span style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Keep the overall display clean, colorful, and attractive. If your 
board is boring, your viewers will automatically be bored. Yet using color, 
pictures, charts, and a lively presentation will attract an audience and add to 
the quality of your project. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Tips for your presentation:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-family: Wingdings">Ø<span style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>PRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE!!!! You don’t necessarily need a 
memorized speech, but make sure you know what you want to say. Judging is on a 
times schedule, so prepare a presentation for your judge that guides them 
through the project. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-family: Wingdings">Ø<span style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Make sure you DEMONSTRATE, rather than just explain. In other 
words, don’t keep lecturing to your judge—SHOW them your data, charts, etc. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-family: Wingdings">Ø<span style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Stand up straight, look professional, and be proud of your work. 
Your judge doesn’t know you, so they will judge you based on your appearance. 
Make sure you look enthusiastic about your project (and hopefully you are) and 
eager to share your knowledge with them. Also, good posture and a positive 
attitude will keep you confidant throughout the judging period. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-family: Wingdings">Ø<span style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Look at the judge, NOT at your board. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-family: Wingdings">Ø<span style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Don’t read off of your board. Again, PRACTICE!!!!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-family: Wingdings">Ø<span style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Anticipate the questions your judges may ask you. Ask your 
teacher, mentor, or someone familiar and unfamiliar with your project to listen 
to your presentation and ask you questions. Different people perceive things 
differently, so make sure you take the time to hear their suggestions in order 
to make your presentation is as thorough as possible.</p>
