Goldson graduated as valedictorian of Coxsackie-Athens High School (<a href="http://blog.swiftkickonline.com/2010/07/valedictorian-speaks-out-against-schooling-in-graduation-speech.html">http://blog.swiftkickonline.com/2010/07/valedictorian-speaks-out-against-schooling-in-graduation-speech.html</a>)<br>

<em><span style="font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">There
is a story of a young, but earnest Zen student who approached his teacher, and
asked the Master, "If I work very hard and diligently, how long will it
take for me to find Zen? The Master thought about this, then replied, "Ten
years . ." The student then said, "But what if I work very, very hard
and really apply myself to learn fast -- How long then?" Replied the
Master, "Well, twenty years." "But, if I really, really work at
it, how long then?" asked the student. "Thirty years," replied
the Master. "But, I do not understand," said the disappointed
student. "At each time that I say I will work harder, you say it will take
me longer. Why do you say that?" Replied the Master, "When you have
one eye on the goal, you only have one eye on the path."&nbsp;</span></em><br>
<br>
<em><span style="font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">This
is the dilemma I've faced within the American education system. We are so
focused on a goal, whether it be passing a test, or graduating as first in the
class. However, in this way, we do not really learn. We do whatever it takes to
achieve our original objective.&nbsp;</span></em><br>
<br>
<em><span style="font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Some
of you may be thinking, "Well, if you pass a test, or become
valedictorian, didn't you learn something? Well, yes, you learned something,
but not all that you could have. Perhaps, you only learned how to memorize
names, places, and dates to later on forget in order to clear your mind for the
next test. </span></em><strong><i><span style="font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">School is not all that it can be. Right
now, it is a place for most people to determine that their goal is to get out
as soon as possible.&nbsp;</span></i></strong><br>
<br>
<em><span style="font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">I
am now accomplishing that goal. I am graduating. I should look at this as a
positive experience, especially being at the top of my class. However, in
retrospect, I cannot say that I am any more intelligent than my peers. I can
attest that I am only the best at doing what I am told and working the system.
Yet, here I stand, and I am supposed to be proud that I have completed this
period of indoctrination. I will leave in the fall to go on to the next phase
expected of me, in order to receive a paper document that certifies that I am
capable of work. But I contest that I am a human being, a thinker, an
adventurer - not a worker. A worker is someone who is trapped within repetition
- a slave of the system set up before him. </span></em><strong><i><span style="font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">But
now, I have successfully shown that I was the best slave.</span></i></strong><em><span style="font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">
I did what I was told to the extreme. While others sat in class and doodled to
later become great artists, I sat in class to take notes and become a great
test-taker. While others would come to class without their homework done
because they were reading about an interest of theirs, I never missed an
assignment. While others were creating music and writing lyrics, I decided to
do extra credit, even though I never needed it. So, I wonder, why did I even
want this position? Sure, I earned it, but what will come of it? When I leave
educational institutionalism, will I be successful or forever lost? I have no
clue about what I want to do with my life; I have no interests because I saw
every subject of study as work, and </span></em><strong><i><span style="font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">I
excelled at every subject just for the purpose of excelling, not learning. And
quite frankly, now I'm scared.&nbsp;</span></i></strong><br>
<br>
<em><span style="font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">John
Taylor Gatto, a retired school teacher and activist critical of compulsory
schooling, asserts, "We could encourage the best qualities of youthfulness
- curiosity, adventure, resilience, the capacity for surprising insight simply
by being more flexible about time, texts, and tests, by introducing kids into
truly competent adults, and by giving each student what autonomy he or she
needs in order to take a risk every now and then. But we don't do that."
Between these cinderblock walls, we are all expected to be the same. We are
trained to ace every standardized test, and those who deviate and see light
through a different lens are worthless to the scheme of public education, and
therefore viewed with contempt.&nbsp;</span></em><br>
<br>
<em><span style="font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">H.
L. Mencken wrote in The American Mercury for April 1924 that the aim of public
education is not "to fill the young of the species with knowledge and
awaken their intelligence. ... Nothing could be further from the truth. The aim
... is simply to reduce as many individuals as possible to the same safe level,
to breed and train a standardized citizenry, to put down dissent and
originality. That is its aim in the United States."&nbsp;</span></em><br>
<br>
<em><span style="font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">To
illustrate this idea, doesn't it perturb you to learn about the idea of
"critical thinking." Is there really such a thing as
"uncritically thinking?" To think is to process information in order
to form an opinion. But if we are not critical when processing this
information, are we really thinking? Or are we mindlessly accepting other
opinions as truth?&nbsp;</span></em><br>
<br>
<em><span style="font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">This
was happening to me, and if it wasn't for the rare occurrence of an avant-garde
tenth grade English teacher, Donna Bryan, who allowed me to open my mind and
ask questions before accepting textbook doctrine, I would have been doomed. I
am now enlightened, but my mind still feels disabled. I must retrain myself and
constantly remember how insane this ostensibly sane place really is.&nbsp;</span></em><br>
<br>
<em><span style="font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">And
now here I am in a world guided by fear, a world suppressing the uniqueness
that lies inside each of us, a world where we can either acquiesce to the
inhuman nonsense of corporatism and materialism or insist on change. We are not
enlivened by an educational system that clandestinely sets us up for jobs that
could be automated, for work that need not be done, for enslavement without
fervency for meaningful achievement. We have no choices in life when money is
our motivational force. Our motivational force ought to be passion, but this is
lost from the moment we step into a system that trains us, rather than inspires
us.&nbsp;</span></em><br>
<br>
<em><span style="font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">We
are more than robotic bookshelves, conditioned to blurt out facts we were
taught in school. We are all very special, every human on this planet is so
special, so aren't we all deserving of something better, of using our minds for
innovation, rather than memorization, for creativity, rather than futile
activity, for rumination rather than stagnation? We are not here to get a
degree, to then get a job, so we can consume industry-approved placation after
placation. There is more, and more still.&nbsp;</span></em><br>
<br>
<em><span style="font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">The
saddest part is that the majority of students don't have the opportunity to
reflect as I did. The majority of students are put through the same
brainwashing techniques in order to create a complacent labor force working in
the interests of large corporations and secretive government, and worst of all,
they are completely unaware of it. I will never be able to turn back these 18
years. I can't run away to another country with an education system meant to
enlighten rather than condition. This part of my life is over, and I want to
make sure that no other child will have his or her potential suppressed by
powers meant to exploit and control. We are human beings. We are thinkers,
dreamers, explorers, artists, writers, engineers. We are anything we want to be
- but only if we have an educational system that supports us rather than holds
us down. A tree can grow, but only if its roots are given a healthy foundation.&nbsp;</span></em><br>
<br>
<em><span style="font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">For
those of you out there that must continue to sit in desks and yield to the
authoritarian ideologies of instructors, do not be disheartened. You still have
the opportunity to stand up, ask questions, be critical, and </span></em><strong><i><span style="font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">create
your own perspective. Demand a setting that will provide you with intellectual
capabilities that allow you to expand your mind instead of directing it. Demand
that you be interested in class. Demand that the excuse, "You have to
learn this for the test" is not good enough for you. </span></i></strong><em><span style="font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Education
is an excellent tool, if used properly, but focus more on learning rather than
getting good grades.&nbsp;</span></em><br>
<br>
<em><span style="font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">For
those of you that work within the system that I am condemning, I do not mean to
insult; I intend to motivate. You have the power to change the incompetencies
of this system. I know that you did not become a teacher or administrator to
see your students bored. You cannot accept the authority of the governing
bodies that tell you what to teach, how to teach it, and that you will be
punished if you do not comply. Our potential is at stake.&nbsp;</span></em><br>
<br>
<em><span style="font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">For
those of you that are now leaving this establishment, I say, do not forget what
went on in these classrooms. Do not abandon those that come after you. We are
the new future and we are not going to let tradition stand. We will break down
the walls of corruption to let a garden of knowledge grow throughout America.
Once educated properly, we will have the power to do anything, and best of all,
we will only use that power for good, for we will be cultivated and wise. We
will not accept anything at face value. We will ask questions, and we will
demand truth.&nbsp;</span></em><br>
<br>
<em><span style="font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">So,
here I stand. I am not standing here as valedictorian by myself. I was molded
by my environment, by all of my peers who are sitting here watching me. I couldn't
have accomplished this without all of you. It was all of you who truly made me
the person I am today. It was all of you who were my competition, yet my
backbone. In that way, we are all valedictorians.&nbsp;</span></em><br>
<br>
<em><span style="font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">I
am now supposed to say farewell to this institution, those who maintain it, and
those who stand with me and behind me, but I hope this farewell is more of a
"see you later" when we are all working together to rear a pedagogic
movement. But first, let's go get those pieces of paper that tell us that we're
smart enough to do so!</span></em><o:p></o:p></p>
