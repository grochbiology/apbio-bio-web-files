<p>Unit 1 Study Guide: Cell Chemistry (updated 9/29/06) (Ch 1,2 and 17.2, 
journal notes, Cornell notes, warm-ups, labs)</p>
<p>There is no guarantee that all items are mentioned or will show up on the 
unit test.</p>
<p>1. Scientific Method, Independent, Dependent, Standardized (Controlled), 
Control Set-up, Hypothesis, </p>
<p>2. Qualitative vs. Quantitative Observations vs. Inferences</p>
<p>3.Atomic structure, protons, electrons, neutrons, mass number, valence 
electrons, isotope, ions, types of bonds ( in order of strength of bond 
attraction;&nbsp; ionic (strongest), covalent , hydrogen (weakest)), energy 
stored in chemical bonds (valence electrons); solute + solvent = solution, why 
is carbon able to make so many different compounds?</p>
<p>4. pH (hydrogen ion concentration), pH scale (0-6 acid, 7 neutral, 8-14 
base), example acid: HCl, base: NaOH. BTB (bromthymol blue indicator for carbon 
dioxide)</p>
<p>5. biomolecules (structures of carbohydrates, lipids, proteins), know the 
function and recognize monomers of each macromolecule (monosaccharide, nucleotides, amino 
acids), some dimers (sucrose, etc); 
polymers (polysaccharides- starch, glycogen; polypeptides, proteins; nucleic 
acids (RNA, DNA) how polymers are made or broken down via condensation (dehydration) and hydrolysis reaction. 
Lipids- two parts; glycerol and fatty acids (types of fatty acids: saturated, 
unsaturated, trans (how are they different?)</p>
<p>6.Know the chemical indicators for each of the biomolecules (Benedict's, 
Biurets, Sudan III/IV, cabbage juice, Lugol's (IKI))</p>
<p>7. Enzymes (mostly made of proteins, reuseable, substrates, effect of heat 
(temperature), salt concentration, pH on enzyme structure), structure of enzymes, function 
(how enzymes work, lock and key), energy diagrams (how are they set up what do 
they show, activation energy, endergonic, exergonic reactions), 
thermodynamics (1st and 2nd law); chemical reactions (reactants-substrates, 
products)</p>
<p>8. Early earth (how Earth formed, types of gases, condition of surface, 
oceans), requirements for life, first organisms; Miller/Urey Apparatus (purpose, 
set-up, findings)</p>
