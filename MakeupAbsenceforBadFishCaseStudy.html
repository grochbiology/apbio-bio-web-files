In the case study &ldquo;Another Can of Red Bull&rdquo;, the subject
was the use of energy drinks as a source of additional energy for
sports endurance. The case study and video provided information about
energy and the ingredients in energy drinks. The actual question that
was investigated became &ldquo;What are the ingredients in energy
drinks?&rdquo; And &ldquo;Do energy drinks actually provide energy?&rdquo;
The key concepts were cellular respiration and energy
transformations.)</FONT></P>
