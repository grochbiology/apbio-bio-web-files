<P><B>Ultimately the final written report containing all of the parts
below will be due on the date stated on the class calendar or a
severe reduction in the grade will result. If you are participating
in the county fair, remove this document from your binder for the
fair. Don't forget that this project (binder and board) will be
graded after the county fair, make sure you retrieve it after the
fair otherwise you would receive a zero for 6 months hard work).
Please put this rubric back in the binder when you return it to
school the Monday after the fair.</B></P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="widows: 4"><FONT SIZE=5>PROJECT REPORT BINDER
</FONT>&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="widows: 4"><FONT SIZE=5>This is a 1- 2&quot;
ring binder w/ pockets front and rear.&nbsp; Include the following
sections in this order:-</FONT></P>
<P><U>Title Page:</U> The title page bears the title of your project
in the center of the page, several inches from the top. Do not place
student names or school names on this document.&nbsp; Anonymity is
required to prevent judging bias.&nbsp; Do not number this page.</P>
<P><U><B>Table of Contents Page:</B></U>&nbsp; Do not number this
page.&nbsp; 
</P>
<P><U><B>Abstract Page</B></U><B>: </B>Begin numbering the pages
consecutively beginning with the abstract as page 1. Your research
paper begins with an abstract<B>, however the abstract is written
after</B> you&rsquo;ve written the rest of the report sections. The
abstract must not be greater than 250 words and it includes portions
of the other report sections.&nbsp; So though it appears first in the
report, it is written last. (NOTE: this page is <U>NOT</U> included
on the <U>project board</U> as per CCCSEF instructions, but still is
a class requirement in the binder)</P>
<P>Rules for writing abstracts:</P>
<P>Avoid use of pronouns (I, we, our, my&hellip;), Write in past
tense 3<SUP>rd</SUP> person style, Single space, 10 font, indented</P>
<P>* THE FIRST sentence should restate the purpose of the experiment</P>
<P>* THE SECOND sentence should restate your hypothesis</P>
<P>* THE THIRD sentence should restate your null hypothesis</P>
<P>* THE FOURTH-FIFTH sentences summarize the procedure including how
you established the control (this is NOT a list&hellip;use sentences)</P>
<P>* THE SIXTH-EIGHTH sentences summarize the data, including the
statistical analysis and error analysis (this is NOT data tables&hellip;use
sentences to explain the findings)</P>
<P>* THE NINTH-TENTH sentences summarize your conclusion being sure
to mention whether the results supports the hypothesis or null
hypothesis and reference your statistics here that support your
conclusion.&nbsp; 
</P>
<P><U>Statement of Purpose, Hypothesis, or Null hypothesis Page</U>:&nbsp;
The purpose includes your original testable question.&nbsp; The
hypothesis is generally written in an &ldquo;If&hellip;, then&hellip;
format.&nbsp; The null hypothesis states that the variable will not
have a measurable effect and the outcome is unrelated to the
variable.&nbsp; <FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><FONT SIZE=3>Note: if your
project is in the category of &quot;Engineering&quot; follow this
link for the </FONT></FONT><A HREF="http://www.sciencebuddies.com/mentoring/project_engineering.shtml"><FONT SIZE=3>substitution
for hypothesis and null hypothesis </FONT></A>
</P>
<P><U>Introduction/Research Rationale Page:</U>&nbsp; The
introduction restates your clearly formulated and testable hypothesis
as well as explanation of your idea, how you got it and why you think
the work in interesting and important.&nbsp; Include what you hoped
to achieve when you started the project. (avoid pronouns)</P>
<P><U><B>Variables Page:</B></U> These changing quantities are called
<B>variables</B>, and an experiment usually has three kinds:
independent, dependent, and controlled. The <B>independent variable</B>
is the one that is changed by the scientist. In an experiment there
is only one independent variable. As the scientist changes the
independent variable, he or she <B>observes</B> what happens. The
<B>dependent variable</B> changes in response to the change the
scientist makes to the independent variable. The new value of the
dependent variable is <I>caused</I> by and <I>depends</I> on the
value of the independent variable.&nbsp; The number of dependent
variables in an experiment varies, but there is often more than one.
Experiments also have <B>controlled variables (also called
standardized variable)</B>. Controlled variables are quantities that
a scientist wants to remain constant, and he must observe them as
carefully as the dependent variables.&nbsp; Some people refer to
controlled variables as &quot;constant variables.&quot; Also state
the control of the experiment. (avoid pronouns)</P>
<P><U>Review of Literature</U> (5-15 pages) This section of your
paper is your report to the readers of work and research conducted by
others in the past that relates to your topic and facts that help
introduce the readers to the topic. Should be followed by <U>Works
Cited </U><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"> specifically in your
Review</SPAN>.</P>
<P><U>Research Materials and Procedure Pages(s)</U>:&nbsp; List the
materials that you used. Then explain step-by-step what you did in
your experimentation (similar to your Research Plan in your
application). If drawings will make it clearer, draw them on separate
pages and include them in this section. Explain any materials that
you constructed in detail. List any changes you had to make in your
procedure. (avoid all pronouns)</P>
<P><U><B>Discussion Page(s)</B></U><B>:&nbsp;</B> Explain the exact
process by which you reached your conclusions after comparing the
control and experimental variables. Look at your graphs and data
tables before you write this section.&nbsp; This section should flow
logically so that the reader can easily follow your train of
thought.&nbsp; Compare your data with the null hypothesis, what you
would have expected if the observations you made were completely
unrelated to the effect you were expecting, or to your hypothesis,
the predicted results. (avoid pronouns)&nbsp; 
</P>
<P><U><B>Conclusions Page</B></U>:&nbsp; Work out your statistical
analysis before you write this section. &nbsp;Summarize your results
referring to your statistical and error analysis. Be sure to mention
whether the results support the hypothesis or null hypothesis.&nbsp;
&nbsp;MAKE SURE YOU DO NOT INTRODUCE ANYTHING THAT WAS NOT ALREADY
MENTIONED IN THE PREVIOUS PARTS OF YOUR PAPER. (and avoid pronouns)</P>
<P><U><B>Recommendations Page(s):</B></U> Describe what you would do
differently if you were to do this project again.&nbsp;(avoid
pronouns) 
</P>
<P><U>Acknowledgments Page(s)</U>:&nbsp; Give credit to everyone who
assisted you.&nbsp; This may include businesses, individuals,
educational or research intuitions.&nbsp; Identify any financial
support or material donations you may have received. (DO NOT name
anyone associated with the school or the school name).</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><U>References Page(s)</U></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">:
There are two sections to this:&nbsp; </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">(1) WORKS CITED, the bibliography of
works mentioned or quoted in the body of the report . See this link
</FONT><A HREF="http://www.bibme.org/"><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><U>www.bibme.org</U></FONT></FONT>

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">of the sources you used to do
background research and to write the literature review.&nbsp; (APA)</FONT></P>
<P><U>Data Tables:</U> &nbsp;Data from an experiment must always be
presented in a form that allows the results to be readily
communicated to other scientists.&nbsp; Give each Table a number and
a descriptive title and all columns are labeled with units of
measure.&nbsp; The independent variable (or variables) is placed on
the left.&nbsp; The dependent variable (or variables) should be
placed to the right.&nbsp; 
</P>
<P><U>Graphs</U>: Always use an accurate title for the graph.&nbsp;
&nbsp;If you don&rsquo;t know how to make graphs on the computer
using Excel, then be sure to use graph paper to plot the points
accurately.&nbsp; Always record the independent variable on the X-
(horizontal) axis and the dependent variable on the Y-(vertical )
axis.&nbsp; Space intervals evenly along each axis, and plot data
points only at coordinates where data were collected.&nbsp; Set the
maximum values on both axes slightly above the maximum values of the
data.&nbsp; The data should never extend over most of the graph&rsquo;s
area.&nbsp;

also you can look at the class <A HREF="http://www.grochbiology.org/Statistics.ppt/">PPT
</A>on statistics</P>
<P>This (these) statistics could include something as simple as the
mean, median, mode, standard deviation etc. 
</P>
<P><U><B>Error Analysis:</B></U> Students often assume that each
measurement that they make in the laboratory is true and accurate.&nbsp;
Likewise, they often assume that the values that they derive through
experimentation are very accurate.&nbsp; &nbsp; However, sources of
error often prevent students from being as accurate as they would
like.&nbsp; Percent error calculations are used to determine how
close to the true values, or how accurate, their experimental values
really are. Examples for representing your error analysis of data on
the following&nbsp;&nbsp;

<FONT COLOR="#993366"><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=2>You will have
certain photographs (enlarged) placed onto your display board *note:
select a few photos that will: a) prove you did the experiment b)
show the before and after results&nbsp; c) support your conclusion
statement.&nbsp; All other photographs should be placed into plastic
sleeves and into a section titled Experiment Photo Section.&nbsp; You
will then number them and create an index page for photographs.&nbsp;
Example: Let&rsquo;s say you put your best 4 photographs onto the
display board all other photos that are good (don&rsquo;t put every
photo here) go into that section.&nbsp; An index might look like
this:&nbsp; Photograph #1-3 Equipment used (date)&nbsp; Photograph #4
