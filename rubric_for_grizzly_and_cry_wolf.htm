<p>Additional Information</p>
<p>1. Group presentations are expected to look as professional as possible. 
Student presenters are expected to act as professional as possible (avoid 
giggling, laughing, talking to the board) and role playing is expected (students 
should present in &quot;character&quot;.) If you plan on using the LCD, I need to know a 
day in advance.</p>
<p>2. Audience members are expected to be in &quot;character&quot; and act accordingly. 
Any disturbances that are &quot;out of character&quot; will result in a reduction of 
points for the assignment. Inappropriate disruptions include; talking, off task, 
working on presentations, etc. </p>
<p>3. Each stakeholder group must submit a summary of the planned presentation 
on the day that the group goes in front of the council (this includes the &quot;city 
council&quot; and &quot;mayor&quot;.)</p>
<p>4. The groups will have a large portion of the period&nbsp; to present their reports and 
need to leave at least 10 minutes to answer questions. Write down any questions to be asked in your 
journal so you don't interrupt the presenters. Students are expected to ask at 
least 2 in-depth well thought out questions during the 4 days of presentations to 
earn participation credit. </p>
