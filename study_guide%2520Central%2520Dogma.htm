&nbsp;</p>1) Which one of the following
sequences best describes the flow of information when a gene directs
the synthesis of a cellular component? &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>2) The transfer of genetic information from DNA to RNA is called &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>3) Experiments have demonstrated that the "words" of the genetic code (the units that specify amino acids) are &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>4)
A base substitution mutation in a gene sometimes has no effect on the
protein the gene codes for.&nbsp; Which of the following factors could
account for this? &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>5) Which of the following enzymes catalyzes the linking together of RNA nucleotides to form RNA? &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>6) Which one of the following occurs when RNA polymerase attaches to the promoter DNA? &nbsp;<br>7) Where do transcription and translation occur in prokaryotic cells?&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;<br>8) Any change in the nucleotide sequence of the DNA of a gene is called&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;<br>9) Which of the following features would characterize a lytic cycle of viral infection?&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;<br>10) The term gene expression refers to the&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;<br>11) In a prokaryote, a group of genes that is transcribed on a single mRNA molecule is called a(n)&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;<br>12) Most differentiated cells retain…. <br>&nbsp;<br>13) The coding regions of a gene (the portions that are expressed as polypeptide sequences) are called&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;<br>14) Which of the following permits a single gene to code for more than one polypeptide?&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;<br>15)
A particular protein is 400 amino acids long. How many nucleotide base
pairs in the template strand of DNA are required to code for this
protein?&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;<br>16) When examining the genetic code, it is apparent that:&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;<br>17) The relationship between a gene and a messenger RNA is as follows:&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;<br>18) The following is a short segment of an mRNA molecule. The polypeptide it codes for is also shown:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5' AUG/GUG/CUG/AAG 3': methionine-valine-leucine-lysine &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>A
mutation in the DNA occurs so that the fourth base (counting from the
5' end) in the messenger RNA now reads A rather than G. What sequence
of peptides will the mRNA now code for? (You do not need a copy of the
genetic code to answer the question.)&nbsp; <br>19) This diagram shows
the major components of the central dogma of molecular biology as
described in your text. The three numbered arrows represent which three
major processes related to that central dogma? <br><br>&nbsp;<img style="width: 264px; height: 247px;" alt="centraldogma" src="file:///C:/Users/rgroch/Pictures/aaatestpictures/centraldogma.jpg"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;<br>Using
