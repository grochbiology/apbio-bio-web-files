Accelerated Biology is designed for students with a strong interest in
science. Students in this course will use a college-level textbook to
prepare them for taking AP Biology in their Jr. or Sr. year. The course
explores science standards at a greater depth and complexity than in
Biology, incorporating real-world applications in a
problem-based/hands-on approach. Topics include ecology, taxonomy,
evolution, cell biochemistry and physiology, genetics, botany, and
human body systems. This is not a weighted grade course. <br>Prerequisite: A&#8217;s in 8th grade science, 8th grade English and Algebra 1. Concurrent enrollment in Geometry. CSU/UC: &#8220;d&#8221; <br>California Standards Covered in this Course:<br>Biology
follows the California State Science Content Standards for Biology/Life
Science. Emphasis in this course is on the skills identified in the
Course outline below. A full description of the Standards can be
accessed at:<br><a href="http://www.cde.ca.gov/be/st/ss/documents/sciencestnd.pdf">http://www.cde.ca.gov/be/st/ss/documents/sciencestnd.pdf</a> <br><br>Course Outline (Skills Taught): (district biology course outline + research project).<br>Investigation and Experimentation<br>&#9679;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Develop meaningful questions and conduct careful investigations.<br>&#9679;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;Select and use appropriate tools and technology to perform tests,
collect data, analyze relationships, and display data.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#9675;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Microscopy, Tools in Biotechnology, Graphing through computer based spreadsheets<br>&#9679;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;Analyze the experiment in order to identify potential sources of
error. Formulate ideas to minimize uncontrolled variables.<br>&#9679;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Solve mathematically based problems.<br>&#9679;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;Investigate a science-based societal issue by researching the
literature, analyzing data, and communicating the findings. Apply
scientific knowledge to societal issues in order to guide individual
decision making. <br><br>Scientific Process<br>&#9679;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Formulate hypotheses, differentiate between types of variables, distinguish between hypothesis and theory<br>&#9679;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;Scientific knowledge is distinct from other disciplines. It is
based on repeatability, testability, and observable evidence from the
physical and natural world.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Science constantly evolves as new information emerges. <br>&#9679;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Complete a science fair project individually or in a pair, compete in a class science fair.<br>&#9679;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Optionally compete in the local Intel-Affiliated science and engineering fair.<br><br>Biochemistry<br>&#9679;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Understand basics of chemistry as they apply to organic molecules and biological processes<br><br>Cell Biology<br>&#9679;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Differentiate between different types of cells<br>&#9679;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Identify and describe structure and function of cell organelles<br>Genetics<br><br>&#9679;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Nucleic Acids and Protein Synthesis<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#9675;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Describe the structure and function of nucleic acids and proteins<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#9675;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Understand the flow of information from DNA to RNA to Protein to Trait<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#9675;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Articulate sources of genetic variation (mutations, meiosis, sexual reproduction)<br><br>&#9679;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Mendelian Genetics<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#9675;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Predict the probable outcome of a genetic cross<br><br>Ecology<br>&#9679;&nbsp;&nbsp;
