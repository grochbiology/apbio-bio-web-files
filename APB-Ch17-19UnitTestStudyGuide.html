&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Using RNA as a template for protein
synthesis instead of translating proteins directly from the DNA is
advantageous for the cell because<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Be able to figure out what the mRNA strand would be if you know the amino acid sequence.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;What is true for both prokaryotic and eukaryotic gene expression?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;4.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;How does RNA polymerase differ from DNA polymerase?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;5.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Why is the promoter, called the TATA box,
highly conserved in evolution. Which might this illustrate?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;6.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A transcription unit that is 9,000
nucleotides long may use 1,500 nucleotides to make a protein consisting
of approximately 500 amino acids. What might that indicate?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;7.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Why are introns are significant to biological evolution?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;8.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;What is alternative RNA splicing and why is it important?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;9.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A particular triplet of bases in the coding
sequence of DNA is TTT. The anticodon on the tRNA that binds the mRNA
codon would be___?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;10.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Accuracy
in the translation of mRNA into the primary structure of a polypeptide
depends on specificity in the _______?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;11.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Know the structure of a tRNA, what does each part do?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;12.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;There are 61 mRNA codons that specify an
amino acid, but only 45 tRNAs. This is best explained by the fact that
____________?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;13.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A mutation in
which section of DNA could influence the binding of RNA polymerase to
the DNA:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;14.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Transcription of the structural genes in an inducible operon starts when _____?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;15.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If you were to observe the activity of methylated DNA, you would expect it to do what?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;16.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Genomic imprinting, DNA methylation, and histone acetylation are all examples of what?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;17.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Two potential devices that eukaryotic cells
use to regulate transcription are&nbsp; ___ &amp; ____.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;18.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Steroid hormones produce their effects in cells by&#8230;.?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;19.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Gene expression might be altered at the
level of post-transcriptional processing in eukaryotes rather than
prokaryotes because of ________?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;20.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;What is siRNA, what does it do?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;21.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;What are proto-oncogenes, what is their function?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;22.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The incidence of cancer increases dramatically in older humans because&nbsp; ______ ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;23.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Why are viruses referred to as obligate parasites?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;24.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;What are the characteristics of the lytic cycle?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;25.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Most molecular biologists think that
viruses originated from fragments of cellular nucleic acid. Which
observations support this theory?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;26.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;What is the function of reverse transcriptase in retroviruses?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;27.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;What are prions?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;28.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;How can the flu virus moves between species?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;29.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;What would be the most probable fate of a
newly emerging virus that causes high mortality in its host?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;31.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Central Dogma or protein synthesis for
eukaryotes can be simplified to DNA is transcribed into RNA, RNA is
translated into protein. In a brief paragraph explain what this
statement means?<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;32.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Viruses
are &#8220;non-living&#8221; organisms. Why? Is there any evidence that they are
&#8220;degenerative&#8221; organisms?&nbsp; What do they have in common with living
organisms? How are viruses unique?</body></html>
