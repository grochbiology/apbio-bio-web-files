cut and paste this into a word document, and then make more space to
write answers. Watch Crash Course or Bozeman Podcasts, go over your
test corrections and labs. In past years some students do get
together and form study groups for the final.</B></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">&nbsp;There will be a choice of essay questions
on the final exam HOWEVER...you will choose only 2 of these questions
to answer AND THE ESSAYS WILL ONLY BE READ IF YOUR SEMESTER GRADE IS
