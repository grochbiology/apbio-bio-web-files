<p><font size="2">Below is an actual web page from Montana discussing the 
re-introduction of the Grizzly Bear into Montana. The class' challenge is to 
propose the re-introduction into some region of California. Stakeholders will 
take either a pro or con position and present their findings at a town meeting. 
Below this&nbsp; is a list of links.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Why This Measure</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Grizzly bears are federally classified as 
&quot;Threatened&quot; because of their reduced numbers.&nbsp; They occur at all elevations and 
forage on virtually everything from berries, roots and insects to large 
herbivores.&nbsp; They are often associated with Wilderness Areas, but also occur in 
large roadless areas.&nbsp; They are most vulnerable to interactions with people and 
their garbage, livestock and dog food.&nbsp; Grizzly bears must utilize&nbsp;low-elevation 
areas in early spring and late fall (immediately after denning, and prior to 
denning) which can be at risk for subdivision and development.</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Grizzly Bear Range</font></b></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The grizzly bear's historic range covered much of 
North America from the plains westward to California and from central Mexico 
north through Canada and Alaska. Today, the grizzly is found in only about 2% of 
its original range in the lower 48 states. It was listed as threatened south of 
Canada in July of 1975. </font></p>

  <tr>
    <td width="633%" height="96"><font size="2">Currently, south of Canada, 
    there are five grizzly bear subpopulations in Wyoming, Washington, Idaho, 
    and Montana. Grizzlies are difficult to survey, yet it is generally agreed 
    there are more than 350 in the northwest Montana Rockies, about 250 in and 
    around Yellowstone National Park, 25 in the Selkirk Mountains of northern 
    Idaho and northeastern Washington, and 20 to 50 in the Cabinet-Yaak area of 
    northern Idaho and western Montana. Probably less than a dozen grizzlies 
    survive in the North Cascades. There are about 22,000 grizzlies in Canada 
    and more than 30,000 in Alaska.</font><p>&nbsp;</p>

    In 1995 the USFWS helped negotiate two landmark agreements that partially 
    resolved long-standing logging and grizzly issues in the Swan Valley. One 
    involved 296,000 acres of public and corporate lands administered by Plum 
    Creek Timber Company, US Forest Service (USFS), and the State of Montana. In 
    a separate but related agreement, Swan Valley residents developed land 
    management recommendations for private landowners on issues involving 
    sanitation, subdivision, road construction, and real estate disclosures. 
    These agreements will facilitate grizzly movement between the Mission 
    Mountains and the more secure Bob Marshall Wilderness Complex, and help 
    reduce human pressure on grizzlies during the critical spring feeding 
    period. </font>
    <p><font size="2">Other developments in 1995 included: (1) new USFS food 
    handling regulations for wilderness areas; (2) standardized methods for 
    reporting grizzly mortalities and incidents; (3) an information campaign to 
    explain roading issues; and (4) development of a &quot;draft conservation 
    strategy&quot; that describes how the grizzly and its habitat will be managed 
    following delisting.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">In 1995 the Northern Continental Divide population 
    suffered 17 known mortalities: seven from management actions, three from 
    illegal kills, two from train kills, three from natural causes, and two from 
    unknown causes.</font></p>
    <p><b><font size="2">Cabinet-Yaak Ecosystem.</font></b><font size="2"> In 
    the 1980s, only a few grizzlies remained in this area. In a first-time 
    experiment with augmentation, the USFWS radio-collared and released four 
    subadult female grizzlies from British Columbia between 1990 and 1994. None 
    of these bears has caused problems and the initial effort has been judged a 
    success. The ultimate success of this project will depend on whether these 
    female bears survive, find mates, and reproduce.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Between 1986 and 1995, only 13 individual grizzlies were 
    documented in this ecosystem. The USFWS plans to continue monitoring this 
    small population.</font></p>
    <p><b><font size="2">Bitterroot-Selway Ecosystem.</font></b><font size="2"> 
    This six million acres of unoccupied habitat is the largest unbroken expanse 
    of roadless area left in the lower 48 states. The heart of it is in Idaho, 
    but about 250,000 acres extend eastward into Montana. It is historic grizzly 
    country, but the last known grizzly there was killed in 1956. The USFWS is 
    preparing an environmental impact statement (EIS) that will assess the 
    possibility of reintroducing grizzlies to this area; a draft is scheduled 
    for completion in 1996. Reintroduction could begin as early as the summer of 
    1998.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Because this grizzly reintroduction proposal is 
    controversial, a new, collaborative approach is being tried. Four 
    organizations -- Defenders of Wildlife, the National Wildlife Federation, 
    the Intermountain Forest Industry Association, and Idaho's Resource 
    Organization on Timber Supply -- are working together in an unprecedented 
    way to foster grizzly recovery while maintaining the health of local 
    economies. This coalition has developed an alternative for the EIS that 
    would assign &quot;experimental&quot; status to reintroduced grizzlies and authorize a 
    Citizens Management Committee (with minority agency representation) to guide 
    overall management of the Bitterroot Grizzly Recovery Program.</font></td>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Grizzly bears are considered 
top-line predators.&nbsp; As a result, bear/human encounters can be deadly, but not 
just for the human.&nbsp; There have been less than 8 humans killed by grizzly bears 
in Montana in the past 25 years.&nbsp; In contrast, about 20 grizzlies are killed by 
people each year.&nbsp; Bear deaths are most often attributed to habituation to 
people, being attracted by people's garbage, livestock or dog food, and mistaken 
identity during black bear hunting season.&nbsp;</font></p>
