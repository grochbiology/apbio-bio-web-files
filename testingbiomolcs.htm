<p class="MsoNormal">The most common organic compounds found in living organisms 
are lipids, carbohydrates, proteins, and nucleic acids.&nbsp; Common foods, which 
often consist of plant materials or substances derived from animals, are also 
combinations of these organic compounds.&nbsp; Substance called indicators can be 
used to test for the presence of organic compounds.&nbsp; An indicator is a substance 
that changes color in the presence of a particular compound.&nbsp; In this 
investigation, you will use several indicators to test for the presence of 
lipids, carbohydrates, and proteins in various foods.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Problem:</b>&nbsp; What are the major types of organic 
compounds in some common foods?</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<ol style="margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in" start="1" type="1">
  <li class="MsoNormal">honey solution</li>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Part A:&nbsp; Testing for Carbohydrates: Monosaccharides</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Glucose, commonly called “blood sugar,” and fructose, 
“fruit sugar,” are two of the most common monosaccharides.&nbsp; Ribose, an important 
component of nucleic acids, is also a monosaccharide and will be discussed 
during our study of DNA and RNA.&nbsp; Monosaccharides can be identified in a 
substance using an indicator called Benedict’s solution.&nbsp; When Benedict’s is 
heated in the presence of a monosaccharide, the color changes from blue to green 
to yellow to reddish-orange, depending on the amount of monosaccharide present.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<u>Procedure:</u>&nbsp; You can start step 1. and then proceed 
to another test while the water heats up.</p>
<ol style="margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in" start="1" type="1">
  <li class="MsoNormal">Turn on the hot plate to high and fill a beaker half 
  full of tap water.&nbsp; Place the beaker on the hot plate.&nbsp; While this is heating, 
  add 5mL of each sample to a test tube.&nbsp; Add 10 drops of Benedict’s solution to 
  each test tube.&nbsp; </li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">Place the test tubes in the hot-water bath.&nbsp; Heat the 
  test tubes for 3 to 5 minutes, or until the indicator changes color, if it 
  changes color.&nbsp; </li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">With a test tube holder, remove the tubes from the 
  hot-water bath and place them back in the test tube rack.&nbsp; </li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">Record any changes in your data table.</li>
</ol>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Part B: Testing for Carbohydrates: Polysaccharides</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Monosaccharides may join together to form long chains 
called polysaccharides that may be either straight or branched.&nbsp; Starch is an 
example of a polysaccharide formed entirely of glucose monosaccharides.&nbsp; 
Polysaccharides can be tested for using the indicator Lugol’s reagent 
(iodine/potassium iodine).&nbsp; Lugol’s will change color from yellow-brown to 
blue-black-purple in the presence of starch.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><u>Procedure:</u></p>
<ol style="margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in" start="1" type="1">
  <li class="MsoNormal">Add one dropper full of each solution to a well in the 
  well tray.&nbsp; </li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">Add 2-3 drops of Lugol’s to each sample.&nbsp; </li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">Record any changes in your data table.</li>
</ol>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Part C: Testing for Lipids</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Lipids can be generally categorized into two subgroups: 
saturated fats and unsaturated fats.&nbsp; In saturated fats, the carbon chains are 
bonded together with only single covalent bonds and the remaining electrons are 
bonded to hydrogen.&nbsp; This structure keeps the hydrocarbon tails relatively 
straight, so they readily align with each other, pack closely together, and thus 
tend to be solid at room temperature.&nbsp; Saturated fats are most common in 
animals.&nbsp; Unsaturated fats has double bonds between the carbons and therefore do 
not have the maximum number of links to hydrogen.&nbsp; These regions of double 
bonding allow kinks to form in the hydrocarbon tails, keeping them from packing 
closely together.&nbsp; For this reason, unsaturated fats are usually liquid at room 
temperature.&nbsp; Unsaturated fats are common in plants.&nbsp; Because fats are nonpolar, 
we will test for their presence using Sudan IV, a nonpolar dye that will readily 
mix with lipids but form small bubbles or separate with non-fats.&nbsp; Lipids can 
also be tested for using the “sack lunch” method: the lipid is rubbed into a 
brown bag.&nbsp; If a grease spot appears (the brown bag appears translucent), then a 
lipid is present in the food.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><u>Procedure: Sudan IV</u></p>
<ol style="margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in" start="1" type="1">
  <li class="MsoNormal">Add one dropper full of each solution to a clean well in 
  the well tray.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">Add 3-5 drops of Sudan IV to each sample.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">Look for small bubbles or separation.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">Record results in data table.</li>
</ol>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><u>Procedure: Sack lunch</u></p>
<ol style="margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in" start="1" type="1">
  <li class="MsoNormal">Add one dropper full of each solution to a small piece 
  of brown bag.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">Rub the solution until a “wet” spot appears on the 
  paper.&nbsp; Rub off any excess with a paper towel.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">Set the paper aside until the spot appears to dry, about 
  10-15 minutes.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">Hold the brown paper up to a bright light.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">Record observations in data table.</li>
</ol>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Part D: Testing for Proteins</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Proteins are made up of one or more polypeptides, which are 
linear polymers of monomers called amino acids.&nbsp; Amino acids derive their name 
from the amino group and the carboxyl group (which is acidic).&nbsp; Polypeptides are 
formed when amino acids are joined together by peptide bonds between the amino 
group of one amino acid and the carboxyl group of another amino acid.&nbsp; Proteins 
can be tested for using Biuret’s reagent, which reacts with the peptide bond 
between amino acids in the polypeptide.&nbsp; Biuret’s reagent turns from blue to 
purple-violet if peptides bonds are present.</p>
