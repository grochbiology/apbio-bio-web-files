<p>1.&nbsp; What type of plant material did you use for your lab?&nbsp; Example: skin of a 
yellow pear</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; What is accomplished by doing a serial dilution?</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; What is accomplished by doing an extraction of plant matter?</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; What is the purpose of the alcohol used during the plant extraction?</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; So, you created a serial dilution, then you added a few drops of plant 
extract to each of the spot plate wells....Possibly you saw a color change 
occur, or possibly not in some of the spot plate wells...Why were we doing this 
step?</p>
<p>6. Think about extending this lab...what question did it cause you to form, 
and how would you go about testing to answer your question?</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; Search the internet for&nbsp;
<a href="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/ss01/anthocyanin.html">
http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/ss01/anthocyanin.html</a> .&nbsp; What information does 
this site give you that is relative to this lab?</p>
