<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">The </span>
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt">Science Department</span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt"> 
at SRVHS is committed to providing your son or daughter with the best science 
education available.&nbsp; Due to the continued lack of funding for education from 
the State, we are restricted by what we can accomplish. The money the science 
department is around $3 per 
student for the entire school year.&nbsp;&nbsp; For this reason we must ask for your 
support by making a donation to the <b>SRVHS-Science</b>.&nbsp; This donation will 
help maintain the quality of our laboratory courses, demonstrations, provide 
supplies, chemicals and specimens, repair equipment, maintain high safety 
standards, and allow us to upgrade equipment.&nbsp; We would like to thank you in 
advance for your continued and generous support.&nbsp; It is warmly appreciated.&nbsp; 
Without your donations, our laboratory science program would come to a complete 
halt, as your donation is our only adequate means of laboratory funds.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
cost of science materials continues to rise each year, while our allotment of 
funds remains stagnant.&nbsp; The amount of State/District dollars barely covers the 
cost of our paper products for the nearly 1600+ students enrolled in science 
classes every day of the school year. &nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">We would like to recommend 
a minimum <b>lab donation of&nbsp;$</b></span><b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">50.00&nbsp;</span></b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">per 
student for the school year.&nbsp;&nbsp; We will also accept donations of supplies such 
as: office supplies; scientific equipment, such as microscopes, balances, 
glassware, are always welcome donations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year I am starting to ask for 
computer donations; the iMacs are aging quickly (keyboards, mice and batteries 
to name a few) and with the demise of the state program for technology there is 
no funding to replace or repair these computers. If you are interested please 
check out the district requirements for donated machines PC or Mac. The district
