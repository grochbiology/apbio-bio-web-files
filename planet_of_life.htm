    <td><span class="normal">Many of the creatures of the ancient oceans had 
    strange and complex body shapes. What explains their body shapes? Using 
    creatures from the ancient oceans as examples, discuss how a successful body 
    plan may exist virtually unchanged for hundreds of millions of years while 
    others have become extinct.</span></td>

    <td><span class="normal"><i>Anomalocaris </i>terrorized the ancient oceans, 
    preying on all sorts of organisms. Yet some organisms, although smaller and 
    not as strong, escaped this predator. Why do you think some organisms 
    survived attacks while others didn’t? What adaptations made it possible to 
    evade <i>Anomalocaris</i>?</span></td>

    <td vAlign="top"><b><span class="normal">7.</span></b></td>
    <td><span class="normal">Discuss why some organisms may have existed but 
    left no fossil evidence. Without a fossil record, how might scientists 
    determine if the organsism ever existed?</span></td>
