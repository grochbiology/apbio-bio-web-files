<P>Studying works better when it means something to you, when it relates to your 
life. There are a number of ways to do this and I recommend you try as many as 
you can. One fact which we all know from our own experience and psychological 
research has documented is that we remember things better when they are 
connected to emotions. This includes that funny sort of emotion "curiosity" and 
the nice experience of having it satisfied. So, one way to have things stick 
more is to find things that you're curious about.
<P>
<P>Less intuitive, perhaps, but again documented, and believable once you think 
about it, is the fact that we remember things better when they are 
interconnected. To take an example, which of the following lists of 5 words 
would be easier for you to remember?
<P>
<P>1: dog always smoke question just
<P>or
<P>2: cars are hazardous inside cities
<P>
<P>For most of us, the second is easier, because it means something*, it is a 
list of things that are interconnected. Making such connections is called 
<I>elaboration</I> in cognitive psychology and the more elaborate your schema 
for something, the better able you are to remember it: Chess experts have better 
memories for positions of pieces in a chess game than do novices, but not if the 
pieces are randomly placed on the board. You can use these facts about human 
minds in your own studying by actively making connections between ideas. Any 
connections seem to help, but the ultimate connection seems to be to things you 
care about in your life where you bring in the emotion as well.
<P>
<P>SQ3R (Robinson, 1970) is a method for active elaboration of material that you 
read, say in a textbook. It consists of 5 steps. I'll talk in terms of a chapter 
from the text, but this can be adapted to almost anything.
<P>
<P>1. <B>Survey</B> (1 minute): Before beginning reading look through the whole 
chapter. See what the headings are -- the major ones and the subheadings; 
hierarchical structures seem to be particularly easy for our brains to latch 
onto -- check for introductory and summary paragraphs, references, etc. Resist 
reading at this point, but see if you can identify 3 to 6 major ideas in the 
chapter.
<P>
<P>2. <B>Question</B> (usually less than 30 seconds): Ask yourself what this 
chapter is about: What is the question that this chapter is trying to answer? Or 
-- along the curiosity lines -- What question do <I>I</I> have that this chapter 
might help answer? Repeat this process with each subsection of the chapter, as 
well, turning each heading into a question.
<P>
<P>3. <B>Read</B> (slower for some of us than others!): Read one section at a 
time <I>looking for the answer to the question proposed by the heading!</I> This 
is <I>active</I> reading and requires <I>concentration</I> so find yourself a 
place and time where you can concentrate.
<P>
<P>4. <B>Recite/write</B> (about a minute): Say to yourself (I do this out loud 
so I have to study where I don't embarrass myself) or write down (I sometimes do 
this in the margins of the book itself ) a key phrase that sums up the major 
point of the section and answers the question. It is important to use your own 
words, not just copy a phrase from the book. Research shows that we remember our 
own (active) connections better than ones given to us (passive), indeed that our 
own hierarchies are generally better than the best prefab hierarchies.
<P>
<P>5. <B>Review</B> (less than 5 minutes): After repeating steps 2-4 for each 
section you have a list of key phrases that provides a sort of outline for the 
chapter. Test yourself by covering up the key phrases and seeing if you can 
recall them. Do this right after you finish reading the chapter. If you can't 
recall one of your major points, that's a section you need to reread.
<P>
<P>This method works. It works for me and it has worked for many students in the 
past. If you have recommendations for how to improve it, I would welcome them 
for the "next edition" of this mini-lesson.
<P>
<P>* - In fact, one good way to remember the first list is to <I>make</I> it 
mean something, say by adding words: My dog always has a smoke when the question 
arises of just what life means -- note here too that the humorous image adds an 
emotion making the sentence even easier to remember, although remembering 
<I>which</I> words were actually on the list may be a problem.
