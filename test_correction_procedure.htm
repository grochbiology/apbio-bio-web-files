<p>Test Correction Procedure.</p>
<p>1. Tests and answer sheets MAY NOT BE REMOVED FROM THE CLASSROOM.</p>
<p>2. Come in at lunch or after school (see me to make sure I'm available after 
school).</p>
<p>3. On a piece of notebook paper:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Example a question: What organelles contains chromatin? a. Ribosomes, b. 
Smooth ER, c. Nucleus, d. Golgi Bodies</p>
<p>a. write the correct answer (complete sentences please) AND WHY THAT IS THE 
CORRECT ANSWER..(example, &quot;Chromatin is DNA, DNA is found in the nucleus.&quot;)</p>
<p>b. state why you missed the question AND WHY THAT WAS THE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
WRONG ANSWER OR WHY THAT ANSWER ISN'T THE TRUE ANSWER. (example: &quot; ribosomes 
make protein, they don't make DNA&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. look in the textbook and note the page and paragraph 
number that gives an explanation about the subject of the missed question.</p>
<p>4. Leave your test correction sheet in the folder with your &quot;scantron&quot; and 
essay.</p>
<p>5. You will receive 1/4 point per corrected answer which will be added to 
your current test score.</p>
