from D. Mott,&nbsp;Strongsville High School,&nbsp;Strongsville, OH,
from the Science Educators Council of Ohio newsletter)<br><br><br>Scenario:<br>A
person is in a boat on a pond with 10 large rocks. If the person takes
the rocks and throws them overboard into the pond, what will happen to
the level of water at the pond shore? &nbsp;There are three options; a)
no change in water level, b) the water level will rise, or c) the water
level will fall.<br><br>Activity Instructions:<br>1) You can work in smaller groups, but the class must submit one answer with justification. <br>2)
There are beakers, graduated cylinders, test tubes, buckets/tubs,
pebbles, foil, etc. on the front table. If the class needs any other
materials you may ask me if I have those materials available.<br>3) You cannot ask me any questions.<br>4)
You will have 20 minutes of the period to finish this activity, clean
up, and then defend your answer in a public forum demonstrating that
the&nbsp;class can reach consensus upon ONE answer.<br>5) Your grade will be based on your level of participation in this activity. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A= participated<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F= sat back and watched everyone else do everything<br> </body></html>
