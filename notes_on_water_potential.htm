                zero. As <u>solute</u> is added, the value for solute potential 
                becomes more negative. This causes water potential to decrease

  The water potential of pure water in an open container is zero because there

  the water potential. When a solution is enclosed by a rigid cell wall, the 
  movement of water into the cell will exert pressure on the cell wall. This

            water potential, here is a practice problem.

<p>The molar concentration of a sugar solution in an open beaker has been 
determined to be 0.3M. Calculate the solute potential at 27 degrees. Round your 
answer to the nearest hundredth. <br>
The pressure potential of a solution open to the air is zero. Since you know the 
solute potential of the solution, you can now calculate the water potential. </p>
<p>Notes to help answer questions.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Draw a straight line (or use the regression button on your logger pro) 
and determine where the line crosses the x axis.&nbsp; The point at which the line 
crosses the x axis represents the molar concentration of sucrose with a water 
potential that is equal to the potato tissue water potential.&nbsp; At this 
concentration there is no net gain or loss of water from the potato cells.</p>
<p>2. By graphing the data of the percent change in mass of the potato cores, it 
can be determined that the water potential of potato cells is equal to the water 
potential of an unknown sugar solution molarity.&nbsp; Determine that molarity.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Using the explanation above the water potential of the potato cells can 
be determined.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; If the potato is allowed to dehydrate by sitting out in the open air the 
water potential would decrease (be more negative) because the concentration of 
solutes within the cells would increase as potato cells dehydrate.&nbsp; Therefore, 
the osmotic pressure and water potential both decrease.</p>
