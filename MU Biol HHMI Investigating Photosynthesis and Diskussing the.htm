<H4>INTRODUCTION</H4>
<P>In this activity you will investigate some of the factors that influence 
photosynthesis. To do this you will use small round disks of bean leaves. If you 
force the air out of the intercellular spaces of these disks they will sink in 
water. If you allow these disks to go through photosynthesis the air spaces will 
eventually fill with oxygen and the disks will float again. The faster the rate 
of photosynthesis, the sooner the disks will float.</P>
<P>Read over the entire procedure for part one and write a hypothesis for this 
experiment on the lines below.</P><PRE>__________________________________________________________________

<H3>Part One : Light Intensity and Photosynthesis</H3>
<H4>Materials:</H4>
<UL>
  <LI>meter stick 
  <LI>four lights with 50 watt halogen bulbs and reflectors 
  <LI>four 250 ml beakers 
  <LI>five small culture dishes (should fit on top of beakers) 
  <LI>one large culture dish 
  <LI>100 ml graduated cylinder 
  <LI>paper punch 
  <LI>bean seedling that is two to three weeks old 
  <LI>60 ml syringe 
  <LI>timer or stop watch 
  <LI>800 ml .4% sodium bicarbonate solution at 35 C 
  <LI>bottle of 10% dish washing solution 
  <LI>tape and markers for labels </LI></UL>
<H4>Procedure:</H4>
<OL>
  <LI>Adjust the height of the lamps according to the chart below. Group number 
  Light Intensity Distance (cm) from table top to rim of light 
  <OL>
    <LI>100% 13 
    <LI>50% 18 
    <LI>25% 26 
    <LI>12.5% 35 </LI></OL>
  <LI>Label the 250 ml beakers 1 -4. 
  <LI>Fill the large culture dish three quarters full of tap water. 
  <LI>Fill the five small culture dishes half full of tap water. 
  <LI>Punch out 50 disks form the bean leaves, do not punch through the large 
  veins. Place the leaf disks into the water in one of the small culture dishes 
  as you punch them out. 
  <LI>Measure 20 ml of tap water and add one drop of 10% dish soap solution. 
  <LI>Remove the plunger from the syringe. Put your finger over the tip. 
  <LI>Place the 20 ml of soap solution and the 50 leaf disks in the syringe. Be 
  sure all the disks are in contact with the solution. 
  <LI>Insert the plunger and invert the syringe.(the plunger in now at the 
  bottom) 
  <LI>Remove your finger from the tip and slowly push up on the plunger to 
  remove the air from the syringe. 
  <LI>Cover the tip of the syringe with your finger. 
  <LI>Pull back on the plunger with your other hand to create a vacuum in the 
  syringe. 
  <LI>Hold the plunger back for 10 seconds. Gently shake the syringe during this 
  time. 
  <LI>Keeping your finger over the tip of the syringe, let go of the plunger and 
  allow it to return to its original position. 
  <LI>After the plunger has returned to position force out any air bubbles that 
  may have arisen by gently pushing up on the plunger. 
  <LI>Repeat two or three times until the disks sink. 
  <LI>Place the tip of the syringe in the large culture dish of water. 
  <LI>Pull back on the plunger and fill the syringe with water. 
  <LI>Keep the tip of the syringe in the water but remove the plunger from the 
  syringe. 
  <LI>Lower the syringe into the water and tip it up so the disks are released 
  into the culture dish. The disks should sink. Do not use any that float. 
  <LI>Add 200 ml of 23 C sodium bicarbonate solution to each 250 ml beaker. 
  <LI>Use a forceps to transfer 10 leaf disks into each beaker. Place them in 
  the solution edge-on so air is not trapped under them. 
  <LI>Place each beaker under the correct lamp. (match beaker numbers with 
  distance from the chart) 
  <LI>Cover each beaker with a culture dish with water to absorb the heat from 
  the lamp. 
  <LI>Turn on the lamp and start timers. 
  <LI>Note the amount of time it takes for 5 of the 10 disks to rise to the 
  surface in each beaker. 
  <LI>Record your results below. </LI></OL>

Analysis:

1. Graph time vs light intensity 
2. Summarize the results of this experiment in the form of a paragraph.



















3. List several other variables besides light intensity that can influence
the rate of photosynthesis.












</PRE>
<H4>Part Two : Your Turn</H4>
<P>Now that you know one way to measure the rate of photosynthesis you and your 
group must design an experiment to test the influence of a different variable 
one the rate of photosynthesis.</P>
<P>Procedure: (Write this out on a different piece of paper)</P>
<OL>
  <LI>Select a variable from your list in part one question three to be your 
  experimental variable. Check with your teacher before you proceed. 
  <LI>Write a hypothesis indicating how the variable you selected will influence 
  photosynthesis. Then write a one sentence rationale for your hypothesis. 
  <LI>Write out the steps you will use to test your hypothesis. Be sure to 
  include controls in your design. Be sure to indicate what materials you will 
  need, what type of data you will collect and how you will present the data. 
  You do not have to rewrite all the steps used to remove air form the disks. 
  Assume that you will start with disks with the air removed. 
  <LI>Show your procedure to the teacher for approval. 
  <LI>Perform your experiment and record data.(Prepare bean leaf disks using the 
  procedure in part one) 
  <LI>Prepare and oral report about your experiment . The report must include 
  the following items and each person of the group must present at least one 
  part of the report 
  <UL>
    <LI>hypothesis and rationale 
    <LI>explanation of your procedure and demonstration of lab set up, make sure 
    to discuss controls 
    <LI>presentation of data on the overhead or in poster form 
    <LI>conclusion 
    <LI>possible sources of error or problems you had with the experiment 
  </LI></UL>
  <LI>Present your report to the class. </LI></OL><A
