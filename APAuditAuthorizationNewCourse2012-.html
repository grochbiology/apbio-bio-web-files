<p>Dear Robin Groch:</p>
<p>The College Board is pleased to announce that your Biology course syllabus is 
authorized to use the AP® designation for the 2012 - 2013 academic year at San 
Ramon Valley High School. The College Board applauds and recognizes your efforts 
to provide your students with the academic rigor and college-level experience 
that is the promise of AP. I thank you for the time and effort you put into 
participating in the AP Course Audit. </p>
<p><b>What Does Authorization Mean?</b><br>The authorization of your syllabus is 
an official recognition by the College Board that it meets or exceeds the 
expectations colleges and universities have for your AP subject. Your syllabus 
was reviewed by experienced college and university faculty, who have confirmed 
that it outlines how you provide a college-level learning experience for your 
students. This authorization grants you permission to use the "AP" designation 
on your student's transcripts in association with the authorized course. </p>
<p><b>Renewing Your Authorization</b><br>Once your course has been authorized, 
you do not need to resubmit the syllabus unless the College Board significantly 
revises the AP course. Prior to the 2013 - 2014 school year, you will be sent 
instructions for extending your authorization status for 2013 - 2014. </p>
<p>We understand that you may need to modify or adapt your syllabus or course 
plan to address the needs of your students, reflect new discoveries, and try out 
new approaches. You do not need to resubmit your syllabus when you modify it, as 
long as you are not changing your course so significantly as to eliminate from 
your curriculum one or more of the curricular requirements on the AP Course 
Audit form. </p>
<p>Thank you for all that you do to provide your students with a rigorous, 
college-level experience. The College Board appreciates your efforts to prepare 
students for college success.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Trevor Packer<br>Vice President<br>Advanced Placement Program</p></body></html>
