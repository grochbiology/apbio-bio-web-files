<h3><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">Academic Responsibility and 
Accountability Grade 3% (40 points):</font></h3>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">The purpose of this grade is to encourage 
accountability by rewarding students who are responsible and participating 
appropriately (e.g. journal out at the beginning of the period shows academic 
responsibility, turning assignments in on time, obtaining make-up assignments, 
etc). This is not extra credit.</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">These points will be added on to your 
grade at the end of the semester. </font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">For example: you can lose* the points in 
the following ways:</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">1. Tardy: 5 points and a point per minute 
after 5 minutes tardy</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">2. Cut: 40 points</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">3. Hat: 5 points</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">4. Food, candy, drinks or gum: 5 points</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">5. Disruptive behavior, inappropriate 
language: 1-10 points</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">Note: if you're asked to leave the room 
with a referral, 40 points</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">6. Leaving the classroom early or without 
permission: 40 points</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">7. Leaving the lab tables dirty. 20 
points</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">8. Academic dishonesty (see below) loss 
of points for the assignment, no points may be made up.</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">*</font><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><B>*<font color="#FF0000">You may recover points by
serving lunch detention in class during the quarter that the points were lost, 1 point =1 minute,

remind you.</font></B></FONT></p>

legible.</font></P>

<P><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">2. Take pride in your work. Make every effort to do all of the
assignments, especially for days you have missed. Even though you
receive reduced points for late work you are still responsible for
the subject matter covered. It will help you on the Final exam in the
long run.</font></P>

get notes when absent.</font></P>
