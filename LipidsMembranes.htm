<h2><b>Triglycerides, Cholesterol Esters and a Tip from Sherlock Holmes.</b></h2>

<p align="left">The most common lipid in our bodies is triglyceride and cholesterol
commonly occurs as a fatty acid ester. (And in some of us these compounds are more common
than we would like!) Yet neither is found in biological membranes. Why not? Why are
diglycerides and cholesterol necessary components of plasma membranes, but the closely
related triglycerides and cholesterol esters never present?</p>

<p>Like Sherlock Holmes, who solved one of his more famous cases thinking about a hound
who <i>didn't</i> bark in the night, scientists often gain very useful information
analysing patterns of <i>absent </i>elements as well as ones that are present. &nbsp;
Exactly how do triglycerides and cholesterol esters differ from diglycerides and
cholesterol? </p>

<p>In contrast with membrane lipids, triglycerides and cholesterol esters are entirely
hydrophobic; for this reason they are often called <b>neutral fats</b>. They readily
associate with each other, or other hydrophobic molecules, and often form large droplets
or spherical bodies inside cells. They are not soluble in cytoplasm or other aqueous
solutions, although they will dissove in organic solvents. In contrast, diglycerides and
cholesterol interact with water just like polar solute molecules, <i>and </i>they readily
associate with each other (like their neutral kin). Their hydrophobic property prevents
them from dissolving in aqueous solutions, however, and their polarity prevents them from
forming large, amorphous fat droplets. Such seemingly contradictory behavior is exactly
what is meant by &quot;amphipathic&quot; and is crucial for the ability of phospholipids
to form membranes, as we shall investigate in greater detail in <a href="../chap3.htm"><b>Section
3</b></a>.</p>

<p>Lipids make up the bulk of biological membranes, and it's reasonable to 
suppose their large numbers greatly influence membrane structure and function. 
Indeed, it's not too far-fetched to say membrane lipids and their interactions 
&quot;create&quot; biological membranes. How do such small molecules exert such a large 
role? To answer this question we need to examine the structure of lipids 
themselves. </p>
<p>
<img alt="Phospholipid Molecules" src="phospholipida.gif" align="left" width="205" height="364">Most 
cellular lipids are derived chemically from the three-carbon alcohol, glycerol, 
through covalent linkages with up to three fatty acids. Specifically, a fatty 
acid may form an <b>ester </b>with each of glycerol's three alcohol residues, 
and the resulting lipids are called <b>glycerides </b>All membrane glycerides 
have fatty acid (hydrocarbon or <b>acyl</b>) residues attached to two adjacent 
glycerol carbons and a polar, often charged, residue linked covalently with the 
third carbon, and are called <b>diacyl glycerides </b>or simply <b>diglycerides</b>. 
Diglycerides containing phosphate as part of the polar residue are called, not 
surprisingly, <b>phospholipid. </b>Another major plasma membrane lipid is <b>
cholesterol. </b>Different structural representations of these two membrane 
lipids are presented on the facing page. Note in particular, that both types of 
molecules consist of regions that are hydrophilic, or water-loving, and 
hydrophobic, or water-hating.<b> </b></p>
<p><img src="cholesterola.gif" align="right" width="259" height="291">This 
schizophrenic nature of membrane lipids seems to be no accident! Scroll through 
the <b>Table of Membrane Lipids</b> on the next page and note all of the more 
common forms share this important feature: <b>all membrane lipids have a 
hydrophobic region as well as a hydrophilic one.</b> The long hydrocarbon chains 
of the fatty acids (or the fatty-acid like residues) projecting to the left of 
each lipid will not spontaneously interact with dipolar water molecules (or 
readily dissolve in aqueous solutions). Conversely, the different residues 
projecting to the right of each lipid are all polar and will readily interact 
with water. More technically, membrane lipids are called <b>amphipathic</b> 
molecules, because they possess distinct regions with such different affinities 
for oil and for water. Even the very hydrophobic and insoluble cholesterol is 
slightly amphipathic, by virtue of its single alcohol residue.</p>
<p><img src="lipidsa.gif" align="left" width="242" height="372">The amphipathic 
nature of membrane lipids contrasts strikingly with the neutral <b>
<a href="MembStruc2aside12.htm" target="_self">triglycerides and cholesterol 
esters</a> </b>which are more abundant in our bodies than their amphipathic 
relatives.</p>
<p>How do you think these amphipathic molecules would behave if their 
concentrations were increased in an aqueous environment? in an organic solvent? 
at the interface between an aqueous and an organic solvent? Go on to the
<a href="../chap3.htm" target="whole page"><b>next page</b></a> to consider the 
formation of lipid structures called <b>micelles</b>. </p>
