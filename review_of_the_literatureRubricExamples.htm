<p>Review of the Literature: General Rubric and Examples**</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><b>Start with a general statement of background</b></u> information 
surrounding your project. End with a thesis statement about your project and 
what you are going to examine during your study.</p>
<p>Example: </p>
<p align="center"><b>Review of the Literature</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 200%">With the 
transition to high school, middle school students are faced with a four- year 
journey filled with many options. Students bring to the high school many 
well-established qualities that influence their academic path and academic 
success. Who has primary responsibility for determining the optimal path the 
student will follow? Is it the student, the parent, or the school? What 
roadblocks are there to finding one specific course of action? For example, in 
college preparatory Biology, Algebra I is frequently established as a minimum 
measure of readiness. In response to rising academic rigor, this pre-requisite 
has only been in place for three years at an affluent, public, suburban school. 
Is this pre-requisite really necessary for success; or is it a roadblock for 
access to higher academic tracks? This question&nbsp; is the subject of this study.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><u><b>Second paragraph:</b></u> Explain how you did your search 
for information, example: Google Scholar using the following search words 
&quot;cattails&quot; resulted in 625,000 hits, added &quot;san francisco bay&quot; reduced hits to 
22,500. The addition of &quot; increasing salinity&quot; reduced choices to 10, 200 hits, 
etc. End the paragraph with a specific thesis statement listing at least three 
subtopics of the types of experiments you plan to examine in detail. (NOTE: 
don't write directions for a search ,describe in the past tense using the format 
below).</p>
<p align="left">Example: </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 200%">This 
literature search, covering research from 1986 to 2002, began with the 
descriptor “tracking” which was later modified to “track placement”&nbsp; yielded 31 
hits on
<a href="http://www.eric.ed.gov" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">
<span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none">Educational Resources 
Information Center</span></a> database<span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 200%"> 
(</span>ERIC), <span style="font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 200%">a 
federally-funded national information system</span>. Looking at the descriptor 
lists on the ERIC database records provided another descriptor “academic 
achievement.” This descriptor was also used in Infotrac in the Extended ASAP 
database that provided relevant articles. This literature review has been 
organized around the following related topics: parental involvement, student 
self-concept or motivation, course failure, peer influence and school tracking.</p>

<p align="left"><u><b>Subtopic Sections:</b></u> Use the format below to write 
essentially an abstract of the research/ experiment you read, end with a 
conclusion of the relevance to other studies if possible. Include a critique of 
each research article (located in the last one or two sentences); includes 
discussion of possible flaws in the research procedures (i.e. too sample sample 
size, short time frame), improper analysis of data (i.e. too many variables), 
contradicts other studies' results, etc. You should have 
approximately 3 studies per subtopic.</p>
<p align="left">Example:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%"><b><i>Relationship of Parental 
Involvement to Student Achievement</i></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Baker and Stevensen 
(1986) provide several key pieces of evidence that help explain many of the 
aspects of parental involvement and the relationship to academic achievement in 
high SES districts. High SES, is defined by high income, high educational 
levels, and the advanced occupations among parents (Marsh &amp; Yeung, 1997). 
Student achievement was positively related not only to the educational level of 
the students’ mothers, but also to their increased, proactive advocacy for their 
children over less-educated mothers (Baker and Stevensen, 1986). These 
researchers also conclude from their interviews of 41 mothers of eighth graders, 
that high SES students are more likely to be successful because of their 
parents’ skills in managing school course selection and also by the practices 
employed by parents at home (e.g. homework supervision). The one drawback, 
suggested by Baker and Stevensen (1986), that appears among these parents is a 
tendency to place their children in high academic tracks without due regard for 
prior grade performance. &nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"><u><b>End the Review of the Literature</b></u> with a summary 
paragraph or two. Finish the paragraph with a restatement of your own thesis 
statement. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%">Example:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The placement 
of students in high school courses is a multi-dimensional task involving student 
self-concept, parent involvement and the characteristics of the school. The 
findings of various studies overwhelmingly confirm that high SES plays a major 
role in the placement of students in a high academic track. It is difficult to 
generalize these findings to the placement of students into college preparatory 
Biology classes, since most of the studies used the math scores from the large 
NELS: 88 study. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does tracking in 
general actually harm high SES students? There is a lack of research supporting 
the efficacy of de-tracking Biology courses and also ignoring the traditional 
pre-requisite of Algebra I for course admission? This research proposal seeks to 
look at whether or not there is a correlation between self-concept or 
self-motivation, prerequisites, and academic success in high school Biology.</p>
