<p>College Board Objectives:</p>
<font SIZE="2">
<p>1.B.1 Organisms share many conserved core processes and features that evolved 
and are widely distributed among organisms today. Structural evidence supports 
the relatedness of all eukaryotes. Students should be able to demonstrate 
understanding of the above concept by using an illustrative example such as: </p>
<p>Cytoskeleton (is a network of structural proteins that facilitate cell 
movement, morphological integrity and organelle transport) </p>
<p>Nucleus </p>
<p>Membrane-bound organelles (mitochondria and/or chloroplasts) </p>
<p>Linear chromosomes </p>
<p>Endomembrane systems </p>
</font><font FACE="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" SIZE="2">
<p>Learning Objective: </font><font SIZE="2">The student is able to pose 
scientific questions that correctly identify essential properties of shared, 
core life processes in order to provide insights into the history of life on 
earth.</font></p>
<p><font SIZE="2">&nbsp;</font><font FACE="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Learning 
Objective: </font><font SIZE="2">The student is able to describe specific 
examples of conserved core biological processes shared by all domains or within 
one domain of life and how these shared, conserved core processes support the 
concept of common ancestry for all organisms. </font></p>
<p><font FACE="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Learning Objective:
</font><font SIZE="2">The student is able to justify the claim that organisms 
share many conserved core processes and features that evolved and are widely 
distributed among organisms today. </p>
<p>BIG IDEA 2: Biological systems utilize energy and molecular building blocks 
to grow, to reproduce, and to maintain homeostasis. </p>
</font><font SIZE="2">
<p>2.A.3. Organisms must exchange matter with the environment to grow, 
reproduce, and maintain organization. </font>
<font size="2" FACE="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">a. Water and 
macronutrients are essential for energy transfer and building new molecules. 
Evidence of student learning is a demonstrated understanding of the following 
concepts: </p>
</font><font SIZE="4"><font FACE="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="2">
<p>3. Living systems depend on unique properties of water. </p>
<p>b. Differences in surface-to-volume ratios affect a biological system’s 
ability to obtain necessary resources or eliminate waste products. Evidence of 
student learning is a demonstrated understanding of the following concepts: </p>
<p>1. As surface area increases, volume increases, but the surface-to-volume 
ratio decreases. </p>
<p>2. The surface area of the plasma membrane must be large enough to adequately 
exchange materials; smaller cells have a more favorable surface area- to-volume 
ratio where diffusion is sufficient for exchange of materials with the 
environment. </p>
<p>3. As cells increase in volume, the relative surface area decreases, and 
demand for material resources increases; more cellular structures are necessary 
to adequately exchange materials and energy with the environment. </font></p>
<p><font SIZE="2">Learning Objective: </font>
<font FACE="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The student is able to 
justify the selection of data relevant to the question of what types of 
molecules will an animal, plant, or bacterium take up as necessary building 
blocks and excrete as waste products.</font></p>
<font SIZE="2">
<p>Learning Objective: </font>
<font FACE="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The student is able to 
graphically represent or quantitatively model relationships that exist when 
organisms exchange molecules with the environment and build new molecules to 
maintain organization. </p>
</font></font><font size="2">
<p>Enduring Understanding 2.B. Growth, reproduction, and homeostasis require 
that cells create and maintain internal environments that are different from 
their external environments. </p>
<p>2.B.1. Cell membranes are selectively permeable due to their structure.
</font><font size="2" FACE="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">a. Cell membranes 
are important because they separate the internal environment of the cell from 
the external environment. b. Selective permeability is a direct consequence of 
membrane structure, as noted in the </font><font SIZE="3">
<font size="2" FACE="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">fluid mosaic model. 
Evidence of student learning is a demonstrated understanding of the following 
concepts: </p>
<p>1. Cell membranes consist of a structural framework of phospholipid 
molecules, embedded proteins, cholesterol, glycoproteins, and glycolipids. </p>
<p>2. The phospholipids give the membrane both hydrophilic and hydrophobic 
properties. The hydrophilic phosphate portions of the phospholipids are oriented 
towards the aqueous external or internal environments, while the hydrophobic 
fatty acid portions face each other within the interior of the membrane itself.
</p>
<p>3. Embedded proteins can be hydrophilic, with charged and polar side groups, 
or hydrophobic, with non-polar side groups. </p>
<p>4. Only small, uncharged polar molecules, including H</font><font SIZE="3"><font FACE="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" SIZE="2">2O 
and CO2, and hydrophobic substances (O2 and lipid-solubles) freely pass across 
the membrane; hydrophilic substances such as large polar molecules (including 
glucose) and ions move across the membrane through embedded channel and 
transport proteins. Water moves through channels proteins called aquaporins.
</font></p>
<p><font FACE="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" SIZE="2">c. Cell walls provide 
structural boundaries, as well as a permeability barrier for some substances to 
the internal environments of plant cells. Cell walls are made of cellulose and 
are external to the cell membrane of plant cells. </font></p>
<font size="2">
<p>Learning Objective: </font><font SIZE="3">
<font FACE="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The student is able to 
pose scientific questions about the properties of cell membranes and selective 
permeability based on molecular structure. </font><font size="2">&nbsp;Growth 
and homeostasis is maintained by the constant movement of molecules across 
membranes. </p>
<p><font FACE="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">a. Passive transport does not 
require the input of energy; net flow of populations of molecules move from high 
concentration to low concentration. </p>
</font></font><font size="2" FACE="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">
<p>1. Passive transport plays a primary role in the import of resources and the 
export of wastes. </p>
<p>2. Membrane proteins play a role in facilitated diffusion of charged and 
polar molecules through a membrane. There is no particular protein that is 
required for teaching this concept. Teachers are free to choose a protein that 
best fosters students’ understanding. </p>
<p>3. Internal environments of cells can be hypotonic, hypertonic, or isotonic 
to their external environments</p>
<p>&nbsp;b. Active transport requires energy and moves molecules from low 
concentration to high concentration. </p>
<p>1. Active transport is a process where free energy provided by converting ATP 
to ADP is used by proteins embedded in the membrane to &#8213;pump&#8214; molecules and/or 
ions across the membrane from low concentration to high concentration and to 
establish and maintain concentration gradients important for homeostasis. </p>
<p>2. Membrane proteins are necessary for active transport. </p>
<p>c. Exocytosis and endocytosis are processes by which large molecules are 
moved across cell membranes. </p>
<p>1. In exocytosis vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane to secrete large&nbsp; 
macromolecules out of the cell. </p>
<p>2. In endocytosis the cell takes in macromolecules and particulate matter by 
forming new vesicles derived from the plasma membrane.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</font><font SIZE="3"><font SIZE="2">Learning Objective: </font>
<font FACE="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The student is able to 
construct models that connect the movement of molecules across membranes to 
cellular structure and function. </font></p>
<font size="2">
<p>Learning Objective: </font><font SIZE="3">
<font FACE="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The student is able to use 
representations and models to analyze situations or solve problems qualitatively 
and quantitatively to demonstrate that homeostasis is maintained by the active 
movement of molecules across membranes. </font><font size="2">&nbsp;Eukaryotic 
cells maintain internal membranes that partition the cell into specialized 
regions</font><font size="2" FACE="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">. </p>
</font><font size="2" FACE="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">
<p>a. Internal membranes facilitate cellular processes by minimizing conflicting 
interactions and increasing surface area where reactions can occur. </p>
<p>b. Compartmentalization or membrane-bound organelles localize different 
processes or enzymatic reactions. </p>
<p>c. Evidence of student learning and knowledge level is further clarified in 
4.A.2. </p>

<p>2.D.2. </font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font>
<font FACE="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" size="2">Homeostatic mechanisms 
reflect both continuity due to common ancestry and divergence due to adaptation 
in different environments. a. Continuity is attributed to common ancestry, while 
changes may occur in different environmental conditions. b. Organisms have 
various mechanisms for obtaining nutrients and ridding wastes. Students should 
be able to demonstrate understanding of the above concept by using an 
illustrative example such as: </p>
<p>Gas exchange in plants </p>
<p>Respiratory systems of animals </p>
<p>Nitrogenous waste production in animals </p>
<p>c. A sampling of homeostatic control systems and species of microbes, plants, 
and animals supports common ancestry. Students should be able to demonstrate 
understanding of the above concept by using an illustrative example such as: </p>
<p>Excretory systems in flatworms, earthworms, or vertebrates </p>
<p>Osmoregulation in freshwater and saltwater fish or protists </p>
<p>Osmoregulation in aquatic or terrestrial plants </p>

<font FACE="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The student is able to 
analyze data to identify patterns or relationships showing that homeostatic 
mechanisms reflect both continuity due to common ancestry and change due to 
evolution in different environments. </font><font SIZE="2">Learning Objective:

both continuity due to common ancestry and change due to evolution in different
