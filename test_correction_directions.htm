<p><b>Unit Test Correction Directions (Can only be done during lunch or after 
school or A period if you don't have a class).</b></p>
<p>*Note: Don't count on the fact that you will ALWAYS have an 
opportunity to make test corrections to the Unit Tests in class.&nbsp; BUT when you do 
have the opportunity here is what you can do to earn <b>1/4 pt.</b> back for each 
question you missed. The purpose is to help you see what you did not know 
originally. Also remember the tests may NOT be removed from the classroom or lab.</p>

<div> &nbsp;Label the assignment with the name of the unit test (do not
attach the scantron; leave in the folder please). Turn into the
homework basket.<br></div>

  <font color="#0000ff" face="Times New Roman">1) Write</font><font color="#ff0000" face="Times New Roman">* 
  THAT MEANS HAND WRITTEN* BECAUSE THERE IS A CONNECTION TO THE BRAIN WHEN YOU WRITE 
  MATERIAL BY HAND..</font><font color="#0000ff" face="Times New Roman">.<br></font><font color="#0000ff" face="Times New Roman">Rewrite 
  the question to include the correct answer (Example: Original question: What

your original answer was wrong </strong></font><font color="#0000ff">Write one to two sentences 
TELLING ME why your original answer was incorrect.&nbsp; </font>
<font color="#ff0000">THIS INVOLVES MORE THAN SAYING " I goofed".</font><font color="#0000ff">&nbsp; 
For example:&nbsp; I said that osmosis was an example of active transport, and 
instead osmosis uses passive transport because the cell membrane is always 
permeable to water.</font></span></p></div>

  paragraph number where the answer is found in your textbook, homework etc. (it may be in a lab 
  too, if so, page and paragraph number also apply). You can also use a lecture title and&nbsp; date in your journal.</font></span></div><br><br><br></span><p>&nbsp;</p>
