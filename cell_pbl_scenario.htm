<p class="MsoNormal">Cell PBL Scenario</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Your Accelerated Biology teacher has been assigned to go to
a week of staff development.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Since
the Accelerated and the regular biology students are both studying the cell (at
different learning levels) and knowing that substitute teachers generally don't
have a science background, your teacher has gotten permission for her
Accelerated students to teacher the regular students in her absence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The substitute will be in the class to maintain discipline.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p>

<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;;mso-fareast-font-family:
Times;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;
mso-fareast-language:EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">So that you are thoroughly
conversant in the topic that you are expected to cover, your teacher has
assigned you to develop and design the lesson that you will teach the regular
students. You will also need to develop an assessment tool for evaluating your
activity. Below you will find the <u>key words</u> <span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;</span>you will need to incorporate into the lesson. The group that
comes up with the most creative and effective lesson will earn a full credit on
the weekly quiz.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>“ If you have to teach it, you <u>really</u> know it!”</span>
