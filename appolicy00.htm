<P>Welcome to AP Biology. My goals for you are that you develop; a
life long interest in the biological sciences, critical reading
skills, critical technical scientific writing skills, technological
laboratory skills, and presentation skills. (oh, and have a great
time).</P>
<P>This is a college-level course. Excellent behavior and
participation are expected. Attendance is extremely important.
Tardiness and cuts are not appreciated.&nbsp; Please be prompt. All
assignments are due on the date assigned. If you need to postpone an
assignment due date, contact me before the due date.&nbsp;</P>

Department at SRVHS is committed to providing students with the best

of 8 required student designed inquiry laboratory experiments. It is
expected that students will access some content outside of the
classroom through external sources of information and apply content
in the classroom on a regular basis. Students will be encouraged to
take the advanced placement exam at the end of the course which may
earn college/university credit. This course is for the self-motivated
student with strong reading and writing skills. Note: Coursework

or by prior agreement with the teacher. Assignments are due on the
day assigned unless mutually agreed on by the teacher and student.

objective and checklist procedures identified, handwritten preferred

tables before&nbsp; participating in the laboratory activity. MOST
<U>Lab write-ups need to be typed (some calculations may be
handwritten)</U> and any graphs need to be computer generated using
the best-fit format. There will be specific instructions given in
class or listed on the calendar for each laboratory write-up.<U>
Graphs on notebook paper are not acceptable.</U> If you do not have
access to a computer or graphing program, please use the classroom
computers which are available for your use before school, lunch or
after school. PLEASE NOTE: You must complete&nbsp; homework and

<P>* Homework: students are expected to read and study all assigned
chapters in Campbell&nbsp;<U>Biology 9th edition</U>. Students are
also expected to show complete prep work for each chapters assigned.
There are many ways to demonstrate completion (outlines, Cornell
notes, concepts maps). Second semester students are no longer asked
to turn in chapter notes (I expect that you have established good
habits, if you still want to turn in notes those will be assigned to
the extra credit category).</P>
<P>** The last day to turn in any late assignments is the Monday (or
first day of the week) before finals week in January&nbsp;and in May.
Assignments are considered late after the unit exam covering that
information and only worth up to a maximum 75% point value.</P>
<P>Grades are posted online through School Loop.
<A HREF="http://srvhs.schoolloop.com/">http://srvhs.schoolloop.com</A>&nbsp;
.</P>
<P>Unit tests consist of 20-30 multiple choice questions&nbsp; and
one essay or calculation worth up to 100 points. Reading quizzes are
group quizzes will be worth 5-20 points. Formal Laboratory write-ups
are worth up to 50 points. Semi-formal write-ups range up to 20
points. Homework assignments are worth approximately 5 points per
chapter, incomplete work will result in a zero. Article reviews are
worth 5 points each.</P>

school... you can tutor other bio students(days will be announced),
point values (5 points per hour) will be announced, Science Alliance

<P>The following is the District's policy regarding
non-discrimination:<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;District policy states
that harassment in or out of the classroom is not to be tolerated.
Harassment based on race, ethnicity, able-bodiedness, sexuality,
perceived sexuality, gender, gender expression, monetary standing,
religion or faith-base, or any other factor will be reported to the
administration and dealt with accordingly. This includes slang such
as 'that&rsquo;s so gay' or 'that&rsquo;s retarded.' Both are
considered hate speech.&quot;<U> </U>

ask questions; take notes; get notes when absent.</P>
