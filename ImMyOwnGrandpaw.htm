In the '30s, Latham had a group, the Jesters, on network radio;
their specialties were bits of spoken humor and novelty songs.
While reading a book of Mark Twain anecdotes, he once found a
paragraph in which Twain proved it would be possible for a man to
become his own grandfather.  In 1947, Latham and Jaffe expanded
the idea into a song, which became a hit for Lonzo and Oscar.
It's also one of the songs on Michael Cooney's album of songs for
children.  The published words located and shown below do not exactly match those
sung in the .wav file.

Many, many years ago when I was twenty-three<BR>
<a onMouseover="set_img('gp1l12');" onMouseout="set_img('g');" href="http://gean.wwco.com/grandpa/index.html">I was married to a widow</a> who was pretty as could be.<BR>
This widow had a
<a onMouseover="set_img('gp1l3');" onMouseout="set_img('g');" href="http://gean.wwco.com/grandpa/index.html">grown-up daughter who had hair of red</a>.<BR>
My father fell in love with her and
<a onMouseover="set_img('gp1l4');" onMouseout="set_img('g');" href="http://gean.wwco.com/grandpa/index.html">soon they, too, were wed</a>.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;This made
<a onMouseover="set_img('gp2l1');" onMouseout="set_img('g');" href="http://gean.wwco.com/grandpa/index.html">my dad my son-in-law</a> and changed my very life<BR>
For my
<a onMouseover="set_img('gp2l2');" onMouseout="set_img('g');" href="http://gean.wwco.com/grandpa/index.html">daughter was my mother, 'cause she was my father's wife.</a><BR>
To complicate the matter, even though it brought me joy<BR>
<a onMouseover="set_img('gp2l34');" onMouseout="set_img('g');" href="http://gean.wwco.com/grandpa/index.html">I soon became the father of a bouncing baby boy.</a><BR>
<BR>
My little baby then became a
<a onMouseover="set_img('gp3l1');" onMouseout="set_img('g');" href="http://gean.wwco.com/grandpa/index.html">brother-in-law to dad</a><BR>
And so
<a onMouseover="set_img('gp3l2');" onMouseout="set_img('g');" href="http://gean.wwco.com/grandpa/index.html">became my uncle,</a> though it made me very sad<BR>
For if he was my uncle, then that also made him
<a onMouseover="set_img('gp3l34');" onMouseout="set_img('g');" href="http://gean.wwco.com/grandpa/index.html">brother<BR>
To the widow's grown-up daughter</a>, who, of course, was my
<a onMouseover="set_img('gp3l34');" onMouseout="set_img('g');" href="http://gean.wwco.com/grandpa/index.html">step-mother</a>.<BR>
<BR>
<a onMouseover="set_img('gp4l1');" onMouseout="set_img('g');" href="http://gean.wwco.com/grandpa/index.html">My father's wife then had a son
</a>who kept them on the run<BR>
And
<a onMouseover="set_img('gp4l2');" onMouseout="set_img('g');" href="http://gean.wwco.com/grandpa/index.html">he became my grand-child</a>, 'cause he was my daughter's son.<BR>
<a onMouseover="set_img('gp4l34');" onMouseout="set_img('g');" href="http://gean.wwco.com/grandpa/index.html">My wife is now my mother's mother</a>, and it makes me blue<BR>
Because, although she is my wife,
<a onMouseover="set_img('gp4l34');" onMouseout="set_img('g');" href="http://gean.wwco.com/grandpa/index.html">she's my grandmother too.</a><BR>
<BR>
<a onMouseover="set_img('gp5l14');" onMouseout="set_img('g');" href="http://gean.wwco.com/grandpa/index.html">If my wife is my grandmother, then I am her grandchild</a><BR>
And every time I think of it, it nearly drives me wild<BR>
For now I have become the strangest case you ever saw<BR>
(This has got to be the strangest thing I ever saw)<BR>
<a onMouseover="set_img('gp5l14');" onMouseout="set_img('g');" href="http://gean.wwco.com/grandpa/index.html">As husband of my grandmother, I am my own grandpaw.</a><BR>
<BR>
<EM>Chorus</EM><BR>
I'm my own grandpaw<BR> 
I'm my own grandpaw<BR>
It sounds funny I know<BR> 
but it really is so<BR>
Oh, I'm my own grandpaw.<BR>
