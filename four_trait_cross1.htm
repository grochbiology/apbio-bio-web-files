<p><b>Four Trait Cross (Tetrahybrid)</b></p>
<p><b>Directions:</b>&nbsp; To do your cross:</p>
<p>a.&nbsp; Choose anything to cross (shoes, super heroes, animals etc...)</p>
<p>b.&nbsp; Each crossed &quot;thing&quot; <b>must be heterozygous for a minimum of two </b>of 
its traits and have one X linked trait.&nbsp; (an example genotype would look 
like... AaBbccX<sup>W</sup>Y or aaBBCcX<sup>W</sup>X<sup>w</sup>)***</p>
<p>c.&nbsp; Determine the 4 traits you will cross and their alleles. (use letters 
that can easily be distinguished apart E/e, H/h, T/t,&nbsp; and use proper X 
linked trait notation&nbsp; etc...)</p>
<p>d.&nbsp; Draw, color and label the parts ( see the mouse example below) of the 
things you will cross.&nbsp; (drawings receive more pts and are better than 
photocopies)</p>
<p>e.&nbsp; Use product rule for your cross and neatly organize and show all of your 
work.&nbsp; No punnet squares. </p>
<p>f.&nbsp; Box your genotypes and phenotypes in your final answer</p>
<p>g.&nbsp; Draw the F1 generation phenotype for each offspring (colored, etc). 
Make sure you state whether they are male or female.</p>
<p>h.&nbsp; Final product must be neat, on plain white paper, organized and in color.</p>
<p>i.&nbsp; Incorrect, poorly organized, sloppy, rushed papers will not be 
handed back for redo without grading).</p>
<p>****(Please note that the example is missing the XX or XY traits from the 
picture this student did only autosomal traits and neglected to list which of 
the probable offspring are male or female... example only useful&nbsp; for a 
general idea)</p>
