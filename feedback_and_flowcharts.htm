      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p> As teachers, we are constantly giving our students feedback. But what 
        do we really mean by that word feedback? Ask your students what they think 
        it means to get feedback, and they will probably answer that feedback 
        tells them how well they did something -- usually an assignment. In school, 
        feedback gives information about student performance and how close that 
        performance was to what the teacher considers perfection.</p>
      <p> Likewise, in science, feedback gives information about how close some 
        real, measurable aspect of a phenomenon is to some ideal quantity. The 
        classic example of a feedback system is a thermostat connected to a furnace. 
        The thermostat compares the temperature of the air in the room to some 
        ideal, pre-determined setting. If the temperature in the room is below 
        that ideal setting, the thermostat signals the furnace to send warmer 
        air into the room. After the furnace has been running for a while and 
        the air in the room becomes warmer than the desired temperature, the thermostat 
        stops signaling the furnace. The furnace switches off. If it is cold outside 
        the room, however, eventually the air in the room will grow cool again. 
        When it gets cool enough to be detected by the thermostat as being different 
        from the ideal setting, the furnace switches on again. The cycle repeats 
        indefinitely, as information about the system's status is constantly fed 
        back into the system. Because of their cyclical nature, feedback systems 
        are often referred to as feedback <i>loops</i>.</p>
      <p> We humans, like all mammals, have a thermostat that keeps our bodies 
        at a constant temperature. The thermostat is located in the hypothalamus 
        (centrally located at the base of the brain), but exactly how it operates 
        is not well understand at this time. We do know that it can trigger either 
        heat-producing or heat-dissipating physiological responses. Shivering 
        or sweating, decreasing or increasing blood flow through the skin, and 
        speeding or slowing the metabolic rate -- all are under control of the 
        hypothalamus and can be adjusted depending on whether the environment 
        we find ourselves in is too cold or too hot for our normal physiology.</p>
      <p> Both our technological and physiological feedback systems for maintaining 
        constant temperatures have three key features in common. First, they have 
        in common some sort of sensor that can compare the current status of the 
        system to a desired set point. Second, they both have some sort of mechanism 
        that can respond when there is a difference between the current status 
        and the desired set point. Third, the way they both respond is in a negative 
        manner. By this we mean that the response of the correcting mechanism 
        acts in the opposite direction of the discrepancy between the current 
        status and the desired set point. If the room is too cool, the system 
        responds by starting the furnace in order to raise the temperature. If 
        our bodies are too hot, we start evaporative cooling by sweating in order 
        to lower the temperature. These feedback systems are known as <i>negative 
        feedback systems</i> even though they may cause the temperature to rise 
        (in a <i>positive</i> direction) or fall (in a <i>negative</i> direction).	
        Unfortunately, in the language of our modern culture, the word &quot;negative&quot; 
        has become nearly synonymous with &quot;undesirable.&quot; However, the 
        early mathematicians probably never intended for the terms &quot;negative&quot; 
        and &quot;positive&quot; to be judged subjectively; the terms were simply 
        meant to show that one type of number lay in the opposite direction of 
        zero to the other type. Likewise, there is nothing undesirable about a 
        negative feedback system. On the contrary, a negative feedback system 
        is a good thing because it is a self-correcting system. If the system 
        goes too far in one direction, a correction is made in the opposite direction. 
      </p>
      <p> Flowcharts are codified, visual representations of steps in a procedure 
        or set of directions. They were originally developed in the computer sciences 
        as a way to outline computer programs prior to actually writing them, 
        just as we use outlines to organize our ideas before writing an essay. 
        Besides being useful tools for programs, flowcharts also provide a good 
        way to create visual models of multi-component systems, including feedback 
        systems.</p>
      <p> Flowcharts contain only four types of symbols, three of which are geometric 
        shapes. Ovals, oriented horizontally, are used at the beginning and at 
        the end of a flowchart, to indicate the starting and stopping points of 
        the flowchart procedure. Rectangles, also oriented horizontally, indicate 
        the actual steps to be taken. A flowchart may contain many rectangles, 
        but each rectangle may contain only one, discrete step. Diamonds are used 
        to represent questions that must be answered so that decisions can be 
        made about which steps to take next. Like rectangles, there may be several 
        diamonds in a flowchart, but only one question may be asked at a time. 
        Just as important is the rule that any question asked in a diamond must 
        be capable of being answered by a simple <i>yes</i> or <i>no</i>.</p>
      <p> Arrows, which are the fourth type of symbol in a flowchart, indicate 
        the direction of flow of information, or the sequence of activity. The 
        flowchart below shows one student's method of getting up in the morning.</p>

      <h3 align="left">Procedure</h3>
      <p> Before modeling feedback systems, students should be able to create 
        simple flowcharts such as the example above. You might want to have each 
        student think of an ordinary activity or procedure, and then create his 
        or her own flowchart that illustrates it. If students need more guidance, 
        you could write a list of steps on the chalkboard, such as those needed 
        to take an elevator up to another floor:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> START</li>
        <li> walk to elevator</li>
        <li> push the &quot;up&quot; button</li>
        <li> wait for the elevator to arrive</li>
        <li> is the elevator going up?</li>
        <li> walk into the elevator</li>
        <li> STOP</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Then, with the class, decide how each step should be represented in a 
        flowchart, while you or a student volunteer draw it on the board. The 
        result should look similar to the one on the left in the diagram below.</p>
      <p> Students may want to continue the directions and the flowchart to include 
        arriving at the correct floor and exiting the elevator. In this case, 
        the flowchart will probably look like the one on the right side of the 
        diagram.</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="feedback_and_flowcharts_2.gif" width="261" height="454"></p>
      <p align="left"> Students may have questions about how much detail to include 
        in their flowcharts. Some may want to include steps such as &quot;move 
        your right foot forward&quot; and &quot;move your left foot forward&quot;, 
        instead of &quot;walk to the elevator&quot;. The important idea of flowcharting 
        is that a flowchart forms a <i>practical outline</i>, not a comprehensive 
        set of instructions. As such, it needs to strike a balance between presenting 
        clear, logically ordered steps and being overloaded with excessive details.</p>
      <p></p>
      Once students are facile with flowcharts, they can begin looking for examples 
      of negative feedback systems, either in nature or in technology. Please 
      give students time to think of examples on their own!! They should also 
      be allowed to check out their ideas with other students. Usually it just 
      takes one or two students to come up with an example before other students 
      will start thinking of similar ones. If students are really struggling, 
      you can mention <i>one</i> or <i>two</i> familiar examples: the way we eat 
      when we feel hungry or drink when we feel thirsty, night-lights and street 
      lights with built-in photocells that turn on when it gets dark, the float-valve 
      system that refills a toilet tank after flushing, a car's cruise control 
      device, the way information from our eyes helps us keep our balance (try 
      closing your eyes and then standing while holding one foot up behind you), 
      and the light response of the human eye (pupil dilation and contraction). 
      For students that need a challenge, less familiar and more complex examples 
      include most of the cellular functions (<i>e.g.</i>, the production of enzymes 
      and other proteins) or an airplane's autopilot system. 
      <p> Students can make simple flowcharts of feedback systems without knowing 
        very much about the actual sensing devices, how information from the sensors 
        is conveyed to the responding element(s), and/or how the responding elements 
        carry out their responses. A simple flowchart showing a thermostatically 
        controlled furnace is shown in the figure below. Notice that this flowchart 
        has a starting point but it doesn't have a stopping point. This is a characteristic 
        of feedback systems -- also known as feedback loops. They start up when 
        the device is turned on, as in a furnace, or when life begins for a biological 
        system. They only stop when the device is turned off, or the organism 
        dies. </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="feedback_and_flowcharts_3.gif" width="223" height="174"></p>
      <p align="left"> Although students can create simple flowcharts such as 
        the one shown above, a few well-directed questions could cause students 
        to find out more about their chosen feedback systems. Access to general 
        reference materials (such as encyclopedias and how-things-work types of 
        books) and common technological devices (such as toilets and photocells) 
        can greatly enhance this exercise.</p>

      <h3 align="left">Discussion</h3>
      <p> Give students a chance to look over each other's flowcharts by posting 
        them on a wall and having students circulate among them. You might want 
        to arrange them by categories, <i>e.g.</i>, biological <i>vs.</i> technological 
        feedback systems. Ask students to count the number of different feedback 
        systems that were modeled in each category. It might also be interesting 
        to see if students can find other groupings or commonalities among the 
        systems. For example, how many are related to temperature, or to volume?</p>
      <p> Then ask students what the advantages are of having a negative feedback 
        system. Most biological and technological mechanisms are specialized and 
        so they are designed to operate within a fairly narrow set of circumstances. 
        For example, chemical reactions within cells, nearly all of which are 
        controlled by enzymes, comprise most of the physiological systems in the 
        human body. Our chemistry operates best at temperatures around 98.6&deg; 
        F. At temperatures in the low 90s some important chemical reactions within 
        our bodies occur too slowly to be effective. On the other hand, at temperatures 
        over 105&deg; some enzymes begin to denature, meaning they loose the three-dimensional 
        shapes that are critical to their functioning. Our bodies, therefore, 
        work best at 98.6&deg;, and our internal thermostat, a negative feedback 
        system, keeps them there in all but the most extreme cases.</p>
      <p> Similarly, our cells all need fuel to operate, and our bodies contain 
        several layers of feedback systems to help keep the right amount of glucose 
        circulating in our blood and available to cells that need it. Diabetes 
        is a disease in which part of the feedback loop doesn't function properly 
        due to a lack of the hormone insulin. (This would be a good topic for 
        students to research in the library or on the Internet.)</p>
      <p> In general, a feature of all living things is <i>homeostasis</i>, which 
        is the ability to regulate their internal environments to maintain conditions 
        suitable for life. Another way to describe homeostasis is to say it is 
        the ability of an organism to keep its systems in balance even if the 
        environment around it changes somewhat.</p>
      <p> Once students have a good understanding of negative feedback systems, 
        ask them what a positive feedback system would do. Can they think of any 
        examples?</p>
      <p> Positive feedback systems are usually not a good thing. Imagine an electric 
        blanket for two, divided down the middle, with separate temperature controls 
        for each side (see Figure 4). A man sleeps under one side and his wife 
        sleeps under the other. The wife tends to feel cold at night, so uses 
        her controller to keep the heat turned up high on her half of the blanket. 
        The husband, however, tends to feel warm at night, so he keeps the heat 
        on his side of the blanket turned down low. Normally everyone is happy 
        because both parties have control of their sides of the blanket and a 
        pair of negative feedback systems operates side by side. </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="feedback_and_flowcharts_4.gif" width="217" height="218" alt="negative feedback"></p>
      <p> Now imagine that one night the two controls for the electric blanket 
        get mixed up (see Figure 5). The husband is under his usual side of the 
        blanket, but somehow, unbeknownst to him, he is holding the control box 
        for his wife's side. Meanwhile, the wife is under her usual side but is 
        unknowingly holding the control for her husband's side. The husband, feeling 
        too warm, turns the heat down, but nothing happens to his side -- the 
        blanket is still cranking out heat. So he turns it down some more. Meanwhile, 
        since he was actually turning down the heat on <i>her</i> side of the 
        blanket, the wife feels cold, so she turns up the heat on her controller. 
        But instead of producing more heat, the blanket produces less, so she 
        turns up the heat again. The situation escalates until finally the pair 
        realizes that something is wrong. What is wrong is that they unwittingly 
        created a positive feedback system. When one side of the blanket was too 
        cold, the system responded by making it even colder, and meanwhile, when 
        the other side of the blanket was too hot, the system responded in the 
        same direction -- it made it even hotter. </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="feedback_and_flowcharts_5.gif" width="216" height="215" alt="positive feedback"></p>
      <p> Positive feedback systems are sometimes called &quot;vicious cycles&quot; 
        when they produce undesirable effects. The information that is fed back 
        into the system keeps pushing the system in the same direction, and there 
        might not be any way to stop it. In humans, for example, the condition 
        known as <i>hyperthermia</i>, when the body temperature goes above about 
        105&deg; F, can create a positive feedback system with heat stroke being 
        the disastrous consequence. Hyperthermia occurs when the body's normal 
        cooling mechanisms are no longer effective, usually due to extremely high 
        environmental temperatures and the dehydration that occurs with excessive 
        sweating. The increase in body temperature that results impairs the hypothalamus, 
        so it no longer signals the heat-loss mechanisms that normally operate. 
        With these mechanisms suppressed, the body temperature rises still higher, 
        and with the ensuing heat stroke, permanent brain damage and even death 
        can result. Fortunately, emergency treatment including the administration 
        of fluids and electrolytes, along with immersion in cool water, can interrupt 
        the positive feedback loop. </p>
