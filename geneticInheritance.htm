<P>Additional genetic conditions resulting from inheritance that is non-traditional or non-Mendelian and not covered in Fact Sheet <a href="http://gucdc.georgetown.edu/hugem/fs15.htm"># 15</a>, Non-Traditional Inheritance I, include uniparental disomy , genomic imprinting, and genetic anticipation. While each of these conditions is relatively rare, they are important clinically for those persons who are affected and have important reproductive considerations for their parents.</P>

bold'></span></span></b><span style='font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>
UPD occurs when an individual receives both copies of a chromosome or parts of a chromosome from one parent and none from the other. This is rare and is thought to result from a fetus starting out with three copies of a chromosome and one is lost during early development. The first case of UPD was described in 1988 in a child with cystic fibrosis (CF) who inherited two copies of chromosome 7 with a mutated CF gene from her carrier mother, and none from her non-carrier father.  Subsequently, several genetic disorders resulting from uniparental disomy of single genes or whole chromosomes have been described. 
<br><br>In children where UPD occurs, growth and mental retardation and behavioral difficulties often result.  In UPD, the clinical phenotype varies depending upon which parent donated the genetic material.  This is the case with Prader Willi and Angelman syndromes, discussed in more detail in the next section.  UPD can be diagnosed by molecular genetic studies.

style='font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">   </span>In genomic imprinting, a gene behaves differently depending on whether it is inherited from the father or from the mother.  Genomic imprinting occurs when a gene or chromosome contributed by the mother differs functionally from a structurally identical gene or chromosome contributed by the father.  
There are a number of human disorders in which the clinical manifestations depend on the sex of the transmitting parent.  
<br><br>-	In myotonic dystrophy (a form of muscular dystrophy), the severe congenital form of the disorder is transmitted through the mother.  Approximately 10-20% of her offspring who inherit the disorder will manifest this severe form. 
<br>-	About 60 to 65% of individuals with Prader Willi syndrome (PWS) sometimes characterized by hypogonadism, obesity, and developmental disabilities, are missing a small portion of chromosome #15.  The chromosome carrying the deletion is inherited from the father.  
<br>-	Uniparental disomy accounts for about 30% of the cases of PWS, in which the child inherits both copies of chromosome #15 from their mother and none from the father.  
<br>-	In Angelman syndrome, sometimes characterized by seizures and mental retardation, affected individuals also have a deletion on chromosome 15.  However, the chromosome with the deletion is inherited from the mother.
<br>-	A small percentage of individuals with Angelman syndrome have uniparental disomy, inheriting both affected chromosmes from the father.

style='font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>What Is Anticipation?</span></b><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">   </span>Anticipation occurs when a disease develops in a more severe form and at an earlier age in offspring than in their parents.  Anticipation refers to the progression in severity of a disorder as it is passed down through family generations.  Anticipation disorders frequently involve repeating or expansion of a triplet, which is a tiny segment of DNA that codes for an amino acid and is composed of three bases of nucleotides (combinations of A, C, T, and G).  Expansion of triple nucleotides is a newly discovered human mutation that leads to the production of an abnormally large number of triplet repeats compared to the low number normally found in the gene. 
<br><br>As the condition passes from one generation to the next in a given family, the triplet repeat sequence is amplified causing an increase in severity of clinical manifestation in successive generations.  Triple nucleotides repeat expansion is the cause of more than a dozen genetic disorders, and anticipation is observed in  these conditions.
<br><br>An examples is Huntington Disease (HD), a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disorder. HD results from the expansion of an unstable triple nucleotide repeat in a gene located on the short arm of chromosome 4.  The expanded triplet repeat mutation CAG that causes Huntington disease increases in each generation.  The greater the number of repeats, the more severe are the clinical manifestations of the disease. 

<br><br>Uniparental disomy and genomic imprinting should be considered when an inheritance pattern or pedigree appears unusual and does not follow traditional patterns of inheritance.

<p>For centuries, the understanding of genetic mechanisms has been shaped by the 
Mendelian, or straightforward, patterns of inheritance. However, doctors and 
scientists have been aware of many families with genetic disorders whose stories 
and clinical presentations do not fit into the classic Mendelian pattern of 
inheritance. These types of inheritance are called &quot;non-traditional&quot; or &quot;non-Mendelian 
inheritance&quot; and have significant implications in clinical settings and genetic 
counseling. They include mitochondrial inheritance, and mosaicism, discussed in 
this fact sheet; and uniparental disomy, genomic imprinting, and genetic 
anticipation, which are discussed in the companion HuGEM fact sheet, 
Non-Traditional Inheritance II.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-size: 11pt">What Is Mitochondrial 
Inheritance?</span></b><span style="font-size: 11pt"> The mitochondria are small 
units or particles present inside the cytoplasm of a cell. They are like 
factories providing energy for most of the cell's functions. Mitochondria 
contain their own set of DNA, which is separate from the DNA in the nucleus of 
the cell. A mutation in a mitochondrial gene results in faulty energy production 
and multiple organ disease. <br>
<br>
Mitochondria are present in the egg but not in the sperm. Therefore, 
mitochondrial disorders are inherited from the mother. In mitochondrial 
inheritance, a woman who is affected with a mitochondrial genetic disease passes 
the mutant gene to all her offspring. Her daughters will pass the mutated 
mitochondria to their children. However, her sons will not transmit the disease 
to any of their children. Examples of mitochondrial inheritance include Leber 
optic atrophy, a form of blindness; and certain types of seizures and deafness. 
Mutations in mitochondrial genes can be diagnosed by molecular tests. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>What Is Mosaicism?</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mosaicism refers to the 
presence of normal cells as well as cells carrying a mutation within a single 
individual. The mutation can involve a single gene or a chromosomal anomaly. For 
instance, a child with Down syndrome who is mosaic has some cells that contain 
46 chromosomes, and some cells that contain 47. Individuals with mosaicism tend 
to have milder clinical phenotypes, or clinical manifestations. <br>
<br>
Mosaicism is usually of two types: somatic or germline. Somatic mosaicism occurs 
in somatic cells (all the cells in the body with the exception of eggs and 
sperm) and can lead to medical problems. For instance, a mutation occurring in 
breast tissue may cause cancer of the breast. Typically, somatic mosaicism is 
not passed to future generations. In germline mosaicism, a mutation occurs in 
some or all of the individual's reproductive cells (eggs or sperm). As a result, 
the person can transmit the disorder to future generations. Germline, or gonadal, 
mosaicism for mutations causing autosomal dominant or X-linked inheritance is 
not rare, and often accounts for occurrence of the disorder in offspring when 
the parents are phenotypically normal, that is, the parents are not affected. 
Germline mosaicism has been observed in osteogenesis imperfecta (brittle bone 
disease), neurofibromatosis type I, and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. </p>
