<p class="MsoNormal">ECA: Proteins and Enzymes: <font size="4">Directions: Work in your lab groups to 
answer the following questions, make sure each member of the group understands 
all the concepts. Any figures that are mentioned are found in the 8th Edition.</font></p>
<ol style="margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in" start="1" type="1">
  <li class="MsoNormal">What is the basic structure of an amino acid? Diagram a 
  generic amino acid. </li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">What is an R group? </li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">Explain how amino acids can lead to primary, secondary, 
  tertiary, and <em><span style="font-style: normal">quaternary</span></em> 
  structure in a protein. Explain how R groups can create unique internal 
  structures that are hydrophobic, hydrophilic, polar, or non-polar. </li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">Relate the structures of proteins to membrane proteins. 
  How can the arrangement of R groups facilitate transport of various large 
  macromolecules such as organic molecules (carbohydrates (example sucrose), 
  lipids, protein, or nucleic acids)? </li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">Why is the &#916;G (Gibbs free energy) considered when 
  looking at spontaneous and non-spontaneous reactions?</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">Explain why &#916;G can have a negative value? When is &#916;G 
  zero?</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">Relate &#916;G to activation energy (E­<sub>A</sub>) to 
  exergonic (exothermic) and endergonic (endothermic) reactions.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">Relate the tertiary and/or quaternary structure of a 
  protein enzyme to the specificity of an active site and the corresponding 
  substrate. Don’t forget to consider the charge or polarity of the substrate.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">How do competitive inhibitors work in relationship to 
  the active site? What do non-competitive inhibitors, co-factors, and 
  co-enzymes share in common?</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">Scientists try to design enzymes to work better in 
  commercial applications (Tide detergent, biofuels), what do scientists need to 
  consider in designing these enzymes?</li>

</font><font SIZE="3"><b>Interactions between molecules affect their structure 
and function. </b></font></p>
<p><font FACE="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" SIZE="3">a. Change in the 
structure of a molecular system results in a change of the function of the 
system. </font></p>
<p><font FACE="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" SIZE="3">b. The shape of 
enzymes, active sites, and interaction with specific molecules are essential for 
basic functioning of the enzyme. </font></p>
<p><font FACE="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Evidence of student 
learning is a demonstrated understanding of the following concepts: </p>
<p>1. For a simple chemical reaction to occur, the substrate must be 
complementary to the surface properties (shape and charge) of the active site. 
In other words, the substrate must fit into the enzyme’s active site. </p>
<p>2. Cofactors and coenzymes can either enhance or inhibit enzyme function; 
this interaction relates to a structural change which alters the activity rate 
of the enzyme. The enzyme may only become active when all the appropriate 
cofactors or coenzymes are present and bound to the appropriate places (often 
the active site) of the enzyme. </p>
<p>3. </font><font SIZE="3"><b>No specific cofactors or coenzymes are within the 
scope of the course and exam. </p>
</b></font><font FACE="Times New Roman,Times New Roman" SIZE="3">
<p>c. Other molecules and the environment in which the enzyme acts can enhance 
or inhibit enzyme activity. In some systems a competitive inhibitor can bind 
reversibly to the active site, preventing substrate binding and changing the 
activity of the enzyme. </p>
<p>d. The change in function of an enzyme can be interpreted from a graphical 
representation of concentrations as a function of time. These representations 
demonstrate the relationship between an enzyme’s activity and a competitive 
inhibitor. </p>
