<P>Stomatal aperture provides much information about how leaves sense and 
respond to environmental conditions. Recent evidence suggests many species have 
nonuniform stomatal opening under both laboratory and field conditions, for 
example, different areas of the same leaf seem capable of responding 
independently to microenvironmental conditions (<A 
href="http://www.zoo.utoronto.ca/able/volumes/vol-13/3-brewer/3-brewer.htm#spence">Spence, 
1987</A>). This exercise can be conducted in conjunction with discussions of 
photosynthesis and transpiration, as well as implications of microenvironmental 
conditions to gas exchange. Introductions to stomatal physiology and guard cell 
activity can be found in <A

<P>The purpose of this exercise is to demonstrate how stomata respond to 
microenvironmental conditions by making casts of leaf surfaces and using them to 
evaluate stomatal opening and closing. This exercise takes approximately 1 day 
to set up and can be completed in one 3-hour laboratory period. Leaf surface 
casts also can be made during a field trip for viewing at a later time.

<P><B>Materials</B> 
<P>The following materials are recommended for each group of two students: one 
"dark treated" and one "light treated" plant, one bottle of clear nail polish, 
microscope slides and cover slips, forceps, scalpel, thermometer, lamp, 
permanent marker (e.g., Sharpie), aluminum foil, black electrical tape, Scotch 
tape, and a microscope with an ocular micrometer. 
<P><B>Extensions of this Exercise</B> 
<P>Making surface casts is easily accomplished in the field as well as the 
laboratory. To relate ecology and physiology in a field setting the following 
activities could be pursued using the techniques outlined in this chapter.<BR>
<OL>
  <LI>Compare the same species or several species in two or more different 
  habitats. 
  <LI>Compare sun and shade leaves on the same species to evaluate the effect of 
  canopy position on stomatal response and stomatal density. 
  <LI>Compare stomatal response on well-watered plants with plants allowed to 
  dry out. Then monitor the time required for stomata to respond to watering. 
  <LI>Monitor the effect of temperature on stomatal opening. Well-watered and 
  dry plants would be an interesting comparison. </LI></OL>

<P><EM>A great deal has been written on the opening and closure of the stomata 
produced by light and darkness, but much remains to be done.</EM> (Francis 
Darwin, 1898) 
<P>Nearly 100 years ago, Francis Darwin showed that stomata on leaves respond to 
environmental stimuli. While we have a much better idea of the mechanism of 
stomatal opening and closing as well as information on the responses of stomata 
to certain environmental conditions (e.g., <A 
href="http://www.zoo.utoronto.ca/able/volumes/vol-13/3-brewer/3-brewer.htm#zeiger2">Zeiger 
et al. 1987</A>), there are still mysteries surrounding stomatal response to 
environmental conditions to unravel.

<P>Stomata are small pores in the surface of a leaf (<A 
href="http://www.zoo.utoronto.ca/able/volumes/vol-13/3-brewer/3-brewer.htm#fig3-1">Figure 
3.1</A>). The fundamental function of stomata is to open and close so that the 
rates of water loss and carbon dioxide uptake are regulated. Stomata impose a 
resistance to the diffusion of water vapor and carbon dioxide (<A 
href="http://www.zoo.utoronto.ca/able/volumes/vol-13/3-brewer/3-brewer.htm#fig3-2">Figure 
3.2</A>). When stomata are closed, the resistance to gas exchange is infinitely 
great. In other words, stomata provide an effective barricade to the movement of 
water vapor and carbon dioxide into and out of the leaf. When stomata are open, 
gas exchange of both water vapor and carbon dioxide proceed. <BR><BR>

<P>Changes in the degree of stomatal opening reflect the cumulative effect of 
many physiological responses by a leaf to its environment. Measurements of the 
degree of stomatal opening on a leaf surface provide a convenient visual 
indication of stomatal response to environmental conditions. The dimensions of 
stomatal pores have a big effect on the rate of gas exchange. The rate of gas 
exchange for the entire leaf is determined by the responses of all the stomatal 
pores on a leaf to ambient environmental conditions. 
<P>Many researchers have noticed that stomatal response to seemingly identical 
treatments can vary considerably. Stomata, then, seem to function as separate 
entities which respond individually to the same environmental stimuli. The 
ecological implications of this "patchy stomatal response" are the focus of a 
great deal of current research. Knowledge of stomatal response increases our 
understanding of carbon dioxide assimilation and transpiration rates, as well as 
the nature of ecophysiological adaptations of plants to their environments. 
<P>To study stomatal activity, leaves will be subjected to light and dark 
treatments. We will evaluate how stomates respond to these different conditions 
by preparing casts of leaf surfaces for microscopic evaluation. 
<P>Based on the information provided above, state hypotheses describing the 
effect you expect the conditions listed below to have on stomatal aperture:<BR>

<CENTER><B><A name=pro-1>Procedure 1</A>: Determining Which Leaf Surface Has 
Stomata</B><BR></CENTER>
<OL>
  <LI>Select a plant that has been kept in the light and label the container of 
  the plant "LIGHT." Clip two leaves from this plant. Prepare casts of the 
  leaves surfaces by painting the top surface (adaxial) of one leaf and the 
  bottom surface (abaxial) of the other leaf with clear fingernail polish. It is 
  important that nail polish only be applied to dry leaves or the replica will 
  be cloudy and may not dry properly.<BR><BR>Allow the finger nail polish to dry 
  for about 10 minutes. <EM>Note:</EM> Casts will be very difficult to remove if 
  you allow the nail polish to remain on the leaf surface for more than 15 
  minutes. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>While the nail polish is drying, label microscope slides as either adaxial 
  (top of the leaf) or abaxial (bottom of the leaf). 
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <LI>Cut a piece of Scotch tape approximately 1.5 cm in length. Fold the tape 
  over on itself leaving 0.5 cm of sticky surface exposed. Place the sticky tab 
  of the tape at the edge of the leaf so that it sticks to the nail polish cast 
  (<A 
  href="http://www.zoo.utoronto.ca/able/volumes/vol-13/3-brewer/3-brewer.htm#fig3-3">Figure 
  3.3</A>). Use the remaining tape as a handle to carefully pull the nail polish 
  cast from the leaf surface. You will use the portion of the cast <EM>not 
  covered by tape </EM>to view stomata.

  <P><B>Figure 3.3.</B> Procedure for lifting a surface cast from a leaf 
  surface. </CENTER>
  <P></P>
  <LI>Place the cast on the appropriately labelled slide. Place a coverslip over 
  the cast. (If you would like the slide to be permanent, place a small drop of 
  nail polish on each corner of a coverslip. Then cover the cast with the 
  coverslip so that the nail polish glues the coverslip to the slide.) Repeat 
  this step for the remaining leaf.<BR><BR>
  <LI>Examine the slides under high power to determine which leaf surface has 
  stomata. Carefully survey the entire leaf cast. The leaf surface with stomata 
  should look similar to one of the illustrations in <A 
  href="http://www.zoo.utoronto.ca/able/volumes/vol-13/3-brewer/3-brewer.htm#fig3-4">Figure 
  3.4</A>. For future observations, it will only be necessary to make nail 
  polish casts from the leaf surface with stomata. </LI></OL>
