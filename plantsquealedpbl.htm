<FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS"><P>The Plant that Squealed PBL (a bogus crime)</P>

<P>In the Las Trampas Hills near Danville, a couple of joggers came across the body of a murdered young woman.  Her hands and legs were bound and it appeared as if she had been strangled with her own scarf.  When the police were doing a search of the area, one of the officers noticed that a, Scrub Oak (<i><a href="http://www.calflora.org/cgi-bin/species_query.cgi?where-taxon=Quercus berberidifolia&ttime=1144273685">Quercus 
berberidifolia</a></i>) tree had a fresh scrape on one of its branches.  On the off chance that a murderer had accidentally scraped the plant their way out of the area, the officer took a sample of the plant, placing it into a plastic evidence bag.  While the police were combing the area for additional evidence, they heard a cellular phone ringing.  They found the phone and discovered that it belonged to a man that lived in nearby San Ramon.  When the police went to see the man, he said that he had given the woman a ride from a local gas station.  While he was driving he caught her trying to steal his wallet out of his jacket pocket.  He stopped the truck and told her to get out.  He claimed she must have stolen his phone when he wasn’t looking.  After checking into the background of the young woman, the police found that this was a plausible explanation.  Still, based on the evidence of the cell phone, the police were able to get a search warrant for the man’s pickup truck.  By his own admission, the man admitted that he had recently washed his truck.  The police found no fiber, hair or blood samples in the cab of the truck that could link him to the young woman.  However, in the bed of the truck, there were two oak leaves.  Police took these and placed them into an evidence bag.</P>

<P>The police then began to call universities throughout the United States to 
see if anyone could do DNA fingerprinting on the plant samples to show that the 
two samples had come from the same individual tree. </P>

<P>You are a professor of plant genetics at a local university. You have been 
asked by the police department to determine if it is possible to positively 
identify individual plants from all other plants of that species using 
biotechnology. Write a report addressed to the police addressing this issue. 
Please include any diagrams (gels) that illustrate your points. Include at least 
2 references.</P></FONT>
