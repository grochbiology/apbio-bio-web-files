                  before 10:30 on a recent evening, with a nearly full moon 
                  luminous through mile-high air, Jonathan Van Blerkom climbed 
                  into his car, eased out of his driveway, and threaded his way 
                  through a quiet Denver neighborhood to check on the fate of 
                  some precious human eggs. They had been inseminated that 
                  morning, and some of them should be one-celled embryos by now. 
                  Van Blerkom’s day had begun more than 16 hours earlier, but 
                  human development works the night shift, so Van Blerkom does 
                  too. Every evening, weekends included, he sets out on this 
                  five-minute drive to do one of the things he does best: look 
                  at very early embryos, only hours after fertilization, to 
                  decide if they are likely to become babies. </SPAN></P>

                  this particular night, Van Blerkom dropped in to check on the 
                  status of eight eggs that were harvested that morning from a 
                  persistently infertile woman and soon afterward mixed with her 
                  husband’s sperm. The woman had undergone several previous 
                  cycles of IVF at another clinic without a pregnancy, and Van 
                  Blerkom wasn’t particularly hopeful about this round, either. 
                  “She’s maybe a problem,” he said in his low, urgent voice as

                  this nocturnal assessment. He turned on special heaters and 
                  waited about 15 minutes until the filtered air under a 
                  protective hood—where he would inspect the nascent embryos 
                  under a microscope—had reached 95 degrees Fahrenheit. Then he

                  the better part of the past two decades, human embryologists 
                  have been staring at eggs and early embryos trying to decide 
                  which are “good” and which are not, which embryos seem most 
                  likely to yield a viable infant after implanting and which are 
                  destined to fail. These judgments have traditionally involved 
                  more art than science, as befits a procedure with an overall 
                  success rate of less than 34 percent. Van Blerkom has spent 
                  the last 25 years trying to inject scientific logic into these 
                  snap visual judgments, which last no more than 30 seconds.

                  is at 10 hours after insemination,” Van Blerkom said. “There, 
                  you can see the pronuclei.” There on the screen was the huge, 
                  rotund universe of the female egg cell, its internal jelly, or 
                  cytoplasm, smooth and evenly grained, and there, just below 
                  the equator, two ghostly yolklike circles around the male and 
                  female DNA, mere mirages of genetic material, in close 
                  proximity, nearly nuzzling. Each gamete—egg and sperm—prepares 
                  its half packet of genetic material, known as the pronucleus, 
                  and one of the first organizational tasks of human development 
                  is to bring these two packets together. The glancing proximity 
                  of the male and female pronuclei on the screen represented the 
                  final stage of a daylong dance—a long latitudinal migration by 
                  the sperm’s DNA to the site of the female pronucleus, so that 
                  the male and female chromosomes can “approach each other and 
                  melt into one,” as a 19th-century embryologist poetically put 
                  it. That produces a complete set of human chromosomes and 
                  leads to the first division of the cell.</SPAN></P>

                  though the first several embryos looked smooth and even, Van 
                  Blerkom wasn’t optimistic. “She doesn’t have great stuff,” he 
                  said. When asked how he could tell, he replied, “Just by 
                  looking at the quality of the cytoplasm in the unfertilized 
                  eggs. This is in pretty bad shape. These are not normal

                  at this one,” he continued. “This one has a lot of 
                  disorganization in the cytoplasm.” And indeed, as more of the 
                  eggs filled the screen of the monitor—some fertilized, most 
                  not—the cells frequently had large vacuoles, or fluid-filled 
                  bubbles, in their interior. From experience, Van Blerkom knew 
                  that, although such eggs may become fertilized, they rarely 
                  produce a successful pregnancy. There is even a hint of 
                  evidence that normal-looking eggs from a woman who also has 
                  these abnormal eggs may fail to yield offspring.</SPAN></P>

                  Blerkom said later. “But you only know bits of the story. If 
                  it were an abstract notion, who’d care? But around the world, 
                  thousands of people are looking down microscopes at thousands 
                  of eggs and asking, ‘Should I keep this?’ So life-or-death

                  more than 20 years, Van Blerkom has been trying to understand 
                  the story that egg cells are telling, and although the tale is 
                  far from complete, some compelling new clues to early 
                  development have emerged. As both an academic studying the 
                  basic biology of mammalian development and as an IVF 
                  consultant with access to human egg cells and human embryos 
                  for research purposes, he is one of just a few scientists in a 
                  position to push a revolution in thinking about how—and 
                  whether—life begins. It involves the way an egg cell is built 
                  and how information positioned during that construction

                  extremely early biological events that predate conception by

                  notion of polarity is quite simple. If you imagine the female 
                  egg cell (and later, the fertilized egg) as a spherical planet 
                  with its own intrinsic biological geography, then certain 
                  characteristics of that cell—the location of protein molecules 
                  or RNA messages or biochemical traits like pH or even the 
                  internal connective structures called microtubules—will be 
                  more prominent in certain regions, like one hemisphere as 
                  opposed to the other, or near the surface rather than near the 
                  core. Polarity of this sort has been known for a long time in 
                  the embryological development of simple animals like frogs and 
                  fruit flies. For just as long, it was not thought to be 
                  relevant to development in mammals.</SPAN></P>

                  style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'times new roman'">But in 
                  the past few years, prominent British embryologists have shown 
                  that polarity exerts tremendous influence on the early 
                  development of mouse embryos. And several biologists in this 
                  country are pushing the idea of polarity in human development 
                  to more extreme conclusions. They argue that the fate of an 
                  embryo depends on the way the egg organizes itself, and that 
                  polarity in the egg can ordain either a successful or failed 
                  pregnancy <I style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">before</I> 
                  conception. This has profound implications for our 
                  understanding of life’s origins, for our understanding of why 
                  so many embryos spontaneously abort in the first few days 
                  after fertilization, and for our understanding of why some IVF 
                  procedures may subtly affect early development, with potential 
                  long-term health consequences. </SPAN></P>

                  of all, it means that the scientists who study human 
                  development are increasingly looking at deep time, at events 
                  that shape the human embryo well before fertilization. The 
                  momentum of research, said Van Blerkom, is pushing embryology 
                  back into the realm of cell biology, because the fate of the 
                  organism is so inextricably tied to the quality of one cell 
                  above all: the egg. “In mammals,” he said, “these are things 
                  that are too important to be left to chance.” And so they are 
                  built into the eggs.</SPAN></P>

                  in the 17th century, when British physician William Harvey 
                  made his famous observation “<I 
                  style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">ex ovo omnia</I>” (“from 
                  the egg, everything”), natural philosophers believed that 
                  human development derived entirely from the egg. The sperm, in 
                  size as well as in deed, was puny by comparison. The most

                  maxim. Contrary to the message of 20th-century genetics, the 
                  success of the embryo may have less to do with embryonic genes 
                  than with maternal proteins passed on by the mother, and less 
                  to do with the embryo’s DNA than with the maternal dowry the

                  basic time course of fertilization and early development has 
                  been known for decades. When a sperm cell meets an egg cell 
                  (the oocyte), it burrows through the thick outer rind 
                  surrounding the egg (the zona pellucida), enters the internal 
                  cytoplasm of the egg (the ooplasm), and locomotes its male 
                  DNA—half of the typical number of chromosomes—to the female 
                  half within about three to four hours. During this microscopic 
                  odyssey, the sperm undergoes tumultuous transformations, using 
                  some as-yet-unknown materials in the cytoplasm to build a 
                  “beacon” to find the female pronucleus, its head of DNA 
                  swelling some five times its original size and then later 
                  condensing into chromosomes at the end of the journey. “The 
                  cytoplasm,” Van Blerkom said, “dictates what the sperm 
                  does.”</SPAN></P>

                  the two packets of DNA meld into one complete set of 46 
                  chromosomes, the one-celled embryo begins to cleave, or 
                  divide, becoming a two-celled embryo at around 22 to 28 hours 
                  after fertilization, four cells another day later, and eight 
                  cells around day three. Only then do the embryo’s own genes 
                  fully kick into gear and begin to function. Because these 
                  cells are grouped in a loose, pebbly collection resembling a 
                  berry, this stage of the embryo is referred to as the morula 
                  (from the Latin for “little mulberry”). Around the fourth day, 
                  however, the 15-to-25-celled mulberry dramatically tightens 
                  and seals its connections with neighboring cells (a process 
                  called compaction) and begins pumping fluid into its internal 
                  cavity. Now known as a blastocyst, the embryo undergoes a 
                  dramatic division of cell fate, forming a distinct outer layer 
                  of cells and an equally distinct bulge of about 20 or 30 cells 
                  on the inside. The outer cells (the trophectoderm) become the 
                  placenta; the inner bulge of cells includes embryonic stem 
                  cells, destined to form the entire fetus. Usually by the sixth 
                  day after fertilization, the blastocyst will hatch out of the 
                  egg cell’s still-resilient rind and attach to the 
                  uterus.</SPAN></P>

                  life begins at conception, as many believe, why are so many 
                  lives immediately taken? If, as some ethicists argue, nascent 
                  life must be protected, how do we assess the degree of moral 
                  entitlement due a nascent entity that fails to pass nature’s 
                  own muster perhaps 80 percent of the time? And if the fate of 
                  an organism is indeed inscribed in the earliest biological 
                  inklings of an egg, does life begin with the

                  purely scientific, not to mention pragmatic, point of view, 
                  the main question is more straightforward: Why do so many

                  built. “Much of the developmental biology and ability of the

                  style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'times new roman'">Such 
                  thinking upends long-held assumptions in the world of biology. 
                  Mammalian development was once thought to be essentially 
                  different from embryological development in fruit flies, 
                  frogs, worms, and other laboratory organisms, where 
                  well-defined polarities in the egg—higher concentrations of a 
                  protein in one part of the egg than in another, for 
                  example—ordained such fundamental aspects of body plan as head 
                  and tail, or back and belly. Mammals seemed exempt from these 
                  rules for building a body. In the mouse, it had been shown in 
                  the 1970s and 1980s that if you split an embryo at the 
                  two-cell stage, each resulting cell had the ability to develop 
                  into a full organism. If the egg were indelibly etched with 
                  asymmetric information that unequivocably determines

                  be separated and still produce whole, intact, normal 
                  individuals? “Animal experiments led to the conclusion that 
                  mammalian eggs do not have polarity, but I think that’s a <I

                  similarly shaped by polarity but retain a certain

                  catalog a number of very early polarities that affect both the 
                  competence of the egg and the form of later embryonic 
                  development. The implications of polarity reverberate far 
                  beyond the confines of academia. For example, Van Blerkom and 
                  Albertini have a gentlemanly disagreement about recent 
                  research that may spill out into the public discourse soon

                  techniques might have subtle but long-term health implications 
                  for children conceived in a dish. Indeed, on the night that 
                  Van Blerkom inspected the fertilized eggs at the </SPAN><SPAN

                  clinic, he made this disagreement clear at one point by 
                  holding up a sharp micropipette for my benefit. He remarked 
                  over his shoulder, “This is what I use to take off the cells 
                  that David Albertini says I shouldn’t take off.”</SPAN></P>

                  cells. The female egg cell is a huge biochemical universe unto

                  experiencing infertility problems, about half the trouble can

                  during the fourth week of embryological development but remain

                  churn out haploid sperm cells—that is, sex cells with half the 
                  normal complement of 46 chromosomes. Thus, when a sperm cell 
                  delivers its genetic cargo at fertilization, the one-celled 
                  egg again possesses the full 46 chromosomes. Sperm dysfunction 
                  can arise from the way these cells are built. The sperm has an 
                  acrosome (the head and sheath), a nucleus, and a tail. 
                  Sometimes a club-shaped profile on the head disturbs the 
                  proper construction of the tail. These tail abnormalities can 
                  include looping, folding, and fusion, all of which can result

                  recent animal research suggests that fertility doctors must

                  Blerkom of the University of Colorado published a paper in 
                  1996 suggesting that some cases of male infertility derive 
                  from defects in a tiny structure in the sperm cell called the 
                  centrosome. When a sperm penetrates the egg, it unwraps the 
                  centrosome, an organelle that acts like a construction foreman 
                  overseeing the creation of microtubules in the cell. Sperm DNA 
                  uses these microscopic highways to find the female DNA and

                  <P>While the debate over polarity is much more sophisticated 
                  these days, it is not entirely new. In the late 1930s and 
                  1940s, Arthur Hertig, John Rock, and several colleagues did an 
                  experiment in human embryology that to this day remains 
                  without peer in terms of elegance, revelation, and chutzpah. 
                  Working at the time as a researcher at the Free Hospital for 
                  Women in Brookline, Massachusetts, Hertig persuaded eight 
                  women scheduled to have hysterectomies to record intimate 
                  details of their lives prior to the surgery to remove their 
                  wombs, including when they menstruated and had sex. Armed with 
                  such precise information, Hertig’s research team found 
                  developing embryos in either the fallopian tubes or uteruses 
                  of the women and, adapting the headlight from an automobile to 
                  illuminate their work, took photographs of early, 
                  preimplantation human embryos. Not only were they able to 
                  estimate when fertilization had occurred and also plot the 
                  time course of early human development, they also made an 
                  astonishing discovery: Half the embryos were clearly abnormal. 
                  This was the first concrete hint that most human embryos fail 
                  during the first week of development. Among other things, the 
                  paper that Hertig and Rock published in 1954 contained some of 
                  the first micrograph images of a human embryo at the 
                  two-celled stage. Hertig expressed the hunch that one of those 
                  cells was destined to be placenta, the other the developing 
                  organism.</P>

                  style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'times new roman'">In 
                  some respects, a human egg takes a lifetime to mature. Each 
                  female possesses up to 2 million oocytes at the time of birth, 
                  but that number is winnowed down to about 250,000 by puberty. 
                  Roughly 400 of these unfinished oocytes will mature and be 
                  ovulated during a woman’s reproductive years, although the 
                  quality of the finished eggs declines as she ages. The vast 
                  repository of egg cells remains shelved in the follicles until 
                  the brain sends a signal in the form of monthly bursts of 
                  hormones, which trigger the final maturation cycle. From that 
                  signal, it takes approximately 110 days for an egg to grow, 
                  mature, and finally be released from the follicle. </SPAN></P>

                  late 1980s, Albertini’s group began to focus on a group of 
                  satellite cells that surround the oocyte as it begins to grow 
                  and mature in the follicle. As eggs develop, each one is 
                  surrounded by a herd of much smaller hangers-on. These are 
                  called granulosa cells, and under the microscope they look 
                  like grapes glued to a beach ball. Albertini and his 
                  colleagues noticed that the interaction between the oocyte and 
                  the cells surrounding it was not symmetrical; there were more 
                  cells—and, it would turn out, more molecular back-and-forth 
                  traffic between the egg and the granulosa cells—at certain 
                  regions on the egg.</SPAN></P>

                  on the outside were imposing an asymmetry on the egg,” 
                  Albertini said. The pattern, originally identified in rodents, 
                  has now been shown to be true of cows, rhesus monkeys, and as 
                  of three years ago, humans. “Almost all animals build an egg 
                  in the ovary and position molecules in the top and bottom. 
                  This is a highly conserved evolutionary mechanism to make sure 
                  that when the cell gets subdivided, the cells at the top will 
                  become the head, for example, and the cells in the back may 
                  become a gonad. So you basically have to lay that down in the 
                  egg. And then you’re just carving up the pie. We’ve been the 
                  first to have evidence to support that in the mammal, though 
                  not in the human yet. And there is evidence in human eggs, 
                  from Van Blerkom and others, that molecules are 
                  partitioned.”</SPAN></P>

                  through his IVF-related work, Albertini works primarily with 
                  mouse and primate cells. But his lab’s animal studies have

                  a series of elaborate experiments with mice, Albertini and his 
                  colleagues at Tufts have shown that the small cells bunched 
                  around an egg cell in the follicles are not mere microscopic 
                  groupies. They form connections, known as gap junctions, that 
                  send tendrils much like plumbing lines into the egg. The 
                  plumbing analogy is apt because molecules flow into and out of 
                  the egg through these channels. The molecules are critical to 
                  normal development: When the genes for certain of these 
                  molecules are experimentally erased, the eggs made by female 
                  mice are invariably defective, and the errors fatally disrupt 
                  the normal choreography of egg maturation. </SPAN></P>

                  establishing one of the most important geographic landmarks in 
                  the life of an egg cell—an event, Albertini likes to say when

                  its nucleus? In most animals, you anchor it to one side, and 
                  that sets up all sorts of polarity.” This happens early in the 
                  maturation of an egg cell, he argued, and is shaped by the 
                  position of the cells surrounding the egg.</SPAN></P>

                  <P>When an egg cell matures, it must reduce its complement of 
                  DNA by half. This parceling process, called meiosis, occurs 
                  twice in the egg cell—once during a woman’s fetal development 
                  and a second time as the egg is released from the ovary. 
                  During the initial phase of meiosis, as a woman’s egg cell 
                  reduces its number of chromosomes from the normal 46 to the 23 
                  found in sex cells, it parks one expendable sack of halved DNA 
                  in a spot near the cell surface. This is called the first 
                  polar body, and it defines one of the earliest discernible 
                  landmarks in the developing egg. This so-called animal pole is 
                  where the primordial nucleus of the one-celled embryo is 
                  destined to form. Just prior to ovulation, as the egg begins 
                  its second round of meiosis, it creates a spiderweb trace of 
                  proteins called the spindle, which allows the chromosomes to 
                  separate properly and is critical to a successful pregnancy. 
                  Spindle defects are believed to be the leading cause of the 
                  chromosomal abnormalities that doom so many early embryos.

                  style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'times new roman'">Albertini’s 
                  group now suggests not only that these outside cells tell the 
                  egg where to locate the polar body—and, therefore, the nucleus 
                  and spindle—but also that their plumbing lines soften up the 
                  egg cell’s rind in the opposite, or vegetal pole, to increase 
                  the odds that sperm will penetrate the hemisphere opposite the 
                  nucleus. “We were able to study, in human oocytes, where the 
                  chromosomes were in relation to the polar body,” Albertini 
                  said. “If the egg is born with an animal and a vegetal pole, 
                  the polarity must have come from the ovary because that’s 
                  where the egg is built. The somatic cells [those outside the 
                  egg] may impose that axis. There are more cells, more 
                  connections on one side of the egg than on the other. 
                  Basically, what we’re finding is that the side the nucleus is 
                  on has little contact with outside cells, and the further you 
                  move from the nucleus, the more connections you see.” He 
                  believes that this sets up the internal organization of the 
                  egg’s cytoplasm.</SPAN></P>

                  style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'times new roman'">In 
                  fact, Albertini has preliminary evidence suggesting that the 
                  communication between the egg cell and its surrounding 
                  granulosa cells rises and falls in a precise monthly cycle. 
                  Since the monthly spike of a follicle-stimulating hormone 
                  seems to dampen the information exchange, he is now exploring 
                  the possibility that each ovulatory cycle not only releases a 
                  mature oocyte but also uses the monthly burst of female 
                  hormone to adjust the compass of polarity in the eggs that are 
                  still growing and will be ovulated one, two, or three months 
                  later. “We can only extrapolate to humans, but in the mouse, 
                  our data show that the whole process [of egg maturation] takes 
                  18 to 20 days, and we can detect this asymmetry by the second 
                  or third day of the process. In humans, as an extrapolation, 
                  I’d predict that it would emerge between day 10 and day 20 in 
                  a 100-day process prior to ovulation—three full reproductive 
                  cycles before that egg would be used.” If this preliminary 
                  hint holds up, the implications for maternal health become 
                  significant. Well before a woman attempts to become pregnant, 
                  she may be exposed to environmental effects—diet, prescription 
                  drugs, alcohol, and various toxins—that could affect the 
                  construction of her eggs. “Do you remember what you were doing 
                  three months ago?” Albertini asked.</SPAN></P>

                  Albertini research, while pushing the starting time earlier, 
                  joins an emerging body of research establishing the impact of 
                  polarity on embryological development. In 2001 Magdalena 
                  Zernicka-Goetz and her colleagues at the Wellcome/Cancer 
                  Research UK Institute at the University of Cambridge did a 
                  clever experiment in which they dissolved colored dyes in 
                  olive oil and then stained each of the cells of a two-celled 
                  mouse embryo a different color—one blue and the other pink. As 
                  the embryo developed, the cells of the inner cell mass and the 
                  developing organism were predominantly pink while the cells of 
                  the developing placenta were blue, suggesting that 
                  developmental fate may have been etched into these cells from 
                  the moment of their very first division. This was, in a sense, 
                  a possible molecular answer to the hunch about early mammalian 
                  fates voiced by Arthur Hertig of the two-celled embryo half a

                  are more than just pretty pictures. Ever since the 1970s, when 
                  he worked in England with the developmental biologist Martin 
                  Johnson, Van Blerkom has sought ways to analyze, and 
                  visualize, secret compartments and regions of the human egg 
                  that may offer clues to whether it is endowed with good 
                  fortune or bad. “So many embryos don’t work in the human,” he 
                  remarked one day, in the midst of a six-hour conversation. 
                  “Why do so many go wrong? How does it go wrong? And how can 
                  you use that information? All of this stuff is going to come 
                  back to polarity. Human eggs that don’t develop normally may 
                  be an issue of polarity.” Asymmetries and polarities in both 
                  the cytoplasm and nuclear organization, Van Blerkom 
                  discovered, begin to appear even before fertilization. “It’s a 
                  huge cell!” Van Blerkom said. “It’s a 100-micron cell. And we 
                  know there are different things going on in different parts of 
                  the cell. There’s incredible shuttling within the cells. How 
                  does that happen?”</SPAN></P>

                  Albertini, Van Blerkom sensed that the most important 
                  information in the embryo was not confined to the nucleus but 
                  embedded in the cytoplasm. “If I’ve done anything in this 
                  field,” he said, “it’s to deemphasize the embryo and emphasize 
                  the egg cell. Our work has shown that it all begins with the 
                  oocyte, which can have subtle cytoplasmic defects that are 
                  actually very profound. But,” he added hastily, “you have to 
                  be careful. It’s like looking at canals on Mars. Unless you 
                  can show a consistent pattern [of polarity] and then an effect

                  Blerkom had been seeing hints of polarity since the 1970s, but 
                  one of the major turning points occurred in 1996 when, by 
                  accident, his lab discovered that cells surrounding the 
                  developing egg—the same granulosa cells that had piqued 
                  Albertini’s interest—possessed a receptor very similar to the 
                  leptin receptor. Leptin made front-page news when it was 
                  discovered in 1994 because the molecule appeared to regulate 
                  fat metabolism and obesity. What was it doing in egg cells?

                  maturing eggs in the ovarian follicles—were pumping out leptin 
                  and shipping it into the egg. What’s more, the researchers 
                  showed that leptin is polarized in the egg in such a way that, 
                  after fertilization, the protein is allocated primarily to the 
                  cells that become the placenta, while it is virtually 
                  undetectable in the cells destined to become the fetus.

                  style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'times new roman'">At 
                  first, many embryologists resisted the notion that leptin was 
                  segregated in certain parts of the egg and that this asymmetry 
                  had any significance for the fate of the embryo. “For a long 
                  time, no one believed it,” Van Blerkom said. But mice in which 
                  the leptin gene has been erased are incapable of producing 
                  embryos—the fertilized eggs die almost immediately. And 
                  various experiments tracking leptin inside the mammalian egg 
                  clearly showed a more prominent distribution in one hemisphere 
                  than in the other. It is now believed that this protein acts 
                  as a delayed silencer; it hangs around in the egg and keeps 
                  certain genes from turning on in certain parts of the embryo 
                  until days after fertilization. Again, the appearance of a 
                  protein in a certain part of the egg cell may affect embryonic 
                  development or the formation of organs days and weeks

                  color=#000000>Lately Van Blerkom has been intrigued by another 
                  form of polarity: the way mitochondria, the cell’s little 
                  power plants, migrate in the maturing egg cell. “It’s kind of 
                  like a lava lamp,” he says, “with these blobs of cytoplasmic 
                  elements moving up and down in the cell.” Typically, 
                  mitochondria arrange themselves along the outer edge of the 
                  egg cell. But at certain points in the reproductive cycle, 
                  they migrate en masse toward the nucleus. Wherever they 
                  gather, mitochondria change the local chemical 
                  microenvironment: They cause a lower pH, and that small 
                  change, Van Blerkom believes, can affect the local activity of 
                  certain enzymes. “It’s not a bag of cytoplasm,” he said. “It’s 
                  highly structured, and that structure is changing.”

                  style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'times new roman'">Finally, 
                  Van Blerkom has conducted extensive work on the internal 
                  structural organization of the human oocyte. First the oocyte 
                  constructs the scaffolding of connections known as 
                  microtubules, which allow molecules to move around inside the 
                  cell. Then, toward the end of fertilization, the egg provides 
                  a kind of highway that allows the sperm to make its final 
                  approach to the female pronucleus. “There’s something in that 
                  cytoplasm that allows the sperm to know where it’s going,” he 
                  said. One of the compelling messages—and central paradoxes—to 
                  emerge from these studies of polarity is that even bad eggs 
                  can be fertilized to create an embryo, but only good eggs seem 
                  to create a successful pregnancy. The politics of embryo 
                  research, however, is one reason we don’t know more about what 
                  distinguishes good eggs from bad. Federally funded research on 
                  human embryos, although sanctioned by a congressionally 
                  mandated national bioethics commission in 1975, has faced 
                  unrelenting opposition from right-to-life groups. In 1996 
                  Congress banned NIH funding outright for any research in which 
                  an embryo is destroyed. Van Blerkom calls the issue of when 
                  life begins the “third rail” of developmental biology. “You 
                  can find whatever you want in the embryo to support any 
                  position you have on when life begins,” he said. “A lot of 
                  people believe that life begins at conception. But life also 
                  ends at conception or shortly thereafter—hours after, a day 
                  after, four or five days after. We don’t know why that 
                  happens, and what’s gone wrong. We’d like to know the answers 
                  to those questions,” Van Blerkom said, “but we can’t do those 
                  experiments.” </SPAN></P>

                  implications for making babies, whether through assisted 
                  reproductive technologies or the old-fashioned way. It becomes 
                  a particularly nettlesome question because basic research of 
                  the sort done by Van Blerkom and Albertini has historically 
                  been adapted—snatched, really—for use in IVF clinics, often

                  this is where the polite disagreement between Albertini and 
                  Van Blerkom becomes a matter of intense public and medical 
                  interest. If you believe, for example, that granulosa cells 
                  and other very early features of ovarian ecology set up the 
                  polarities that ultimately determine the quality of a human 
                  egg, as Albertini does, then certain techniques widely used in 
                  IVF may be subtly perturbing the very mechanisms that eggs use 
                  to establish a plan to build an embryo and maximize the 
                  chances that it will develop properly. “We recognized in the 
                  1980s that many culture techniques used by assisted 
                  reproduction were reducing the quality of those eggs,” 
                  Albertini said. “My own skepticism has been growing that we 
                  therefore may be damaging things with what we’re doing to 
                  these eggs prior to embryogenesis.” Other researchers—notably

                  cites a popular IVF technique known as intracytoplasmic sperm 
                  injection, or ICSI, in which sperm is injected by needle right 
                  into the middle of an egg cell. If his polarity research in 
                  mice is true for humans, with its suggestion that sperm are 
                  biased toward entering the egg at the opposite pole from the 
                  cell’s nucleus for important reasons, then ICSI injections 
                  might subtly disrupt patterns of polarity in the egg. 
                  Moreover, ICSI requires the removal of the cells surrounding 
                  the egg; Albertini thinks that might deprive the egg and early 
                  embryo of important signals or alter the time course of 
                  fertilization. Several rare, so-called imprinting disorders, 
                  including Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, a form of gigantism, 
                  have been found in children produced by ICSI, although the 
                  extent and significance of these links is unclear. “Ten years 
                  ago, we wouldn’t have thought about the polarity thing,” said 
                  Albertini. “It wasn’t even on the radar. But now we’re looking 
                  at how we’re making these babies.” Albertini hastened to add, 
                  “I’m certainly a proponent of human-assisted reproductive 
                  medicine, but I’m concerned that we’re rushing technologies 
                  before we’re certain they’re safe and effective.” </SPAN></P>

                  reservations about his clinical ruminations. “If there were 
                  really problems with manipulating eggs, you’d see it, and in 
                  fact you’d have seen it 10 or 15 years ago,” said Van Blerkom. 
                  “In the literature, there are only 26 reported cases of 
                  imprinting-associated disorders with IVF, and that is out of 
                  1.2 million IVF births.” In some hands, he added, ICSI is now 
                  achieving fertilization rates of between 60 percent and 70 
                  percent, even though the technique requires the removal of 
                  surrounding cells. “If these cells were so important,” he 
                  said, “you shouldn’t get such high pregnancy rates.”
