<strong>Laboratory Synopsis</strong> </p>
<p>During this investigative laboratory, you will design and conduct a study 
concerned with some facet of the orientation behavior of a selected animal. You

hypothesis inductively derived from these observations. In this study, you will 
direct your efforts at providing answers to several basic questions of interest 
to biologists: What stimuli elicit orientation behavior? What is the nature of 
the orientation response? How might the observed response be adaptive? At the 
conclusion of this laboratory session you will report your results to the class.

<p><b>Introduction </b></p>
</center>
<p>For many, the orientation behavior of animals is one of the most fascinating 
phenomena in all of biology. In a general sense, humans have been aware of 
animal orientation, migration, and navigation for thousands of years. Whole 
civilizations have thrived or perished based on their understanding of the 
movements made by principal animal food sources. Yet, it was not until early in 
the 20th century that a rigorous analysis of orientation mechanisms began, when 
our knowledge of sensory systems and how other animals detect the world improved 
considerably. </p>
<p>Orientation refers to the spatial organization of movements. Since movements 
are elements of behavior, orientation and behavior are intimately associated. 
For simplicity, we will define behavior as any overt manifestation of life by an 
animal, especially one that takes the form of movements. A behavior <strong>
pattern</strong> is the fundamental unit of behavior, and is defined as a 
sequence of movements characterized by a specific configuration in time and 
space. This underscores the special significance that spatial organization has 
for behavior. Every behavior is spatially oriented in some way. Whether an 
animal walks, grooms, catches prey, or interacts with a social partner, &quot;where&quot; 
and &quot;in which direction&quot; are indispensable features of its behavior pattern. 
Thus, we can define orientation as the process that animals use to organize 
their behavior with respect to spatial features. </p>
<p>The specific orientation systems used by an animal correspond to the features 
of its environment. Many terrestrial organisms are sensitive to humidity levels, 
and are therefore capable of orienting with respect to moisture gradients. But 
humidity is an environmental feature that is not relevant in a totally aquatic 
habitat, and as a result animals that live in water must use physical gradients 
based on other parameters (e.g., temperature or salinity) to help direct their 
movements. Some orientation stimuli are available to both terrestrial and 
aquatic organisms; these include gravity, light and magnetism. </p>
<p>This laboratory exercise will allow you to investigate orientation behavior 
in a variety of animals. It will also help you understand the scientific method 
by giving you first-hand experience with designing, conducting, and interpreting 
a study involving animal orientation. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
<strong>Orienting Stimuli</strong> <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
In orientation studies, one first attempts to identify the nature of the stimuli 
to which the animal is orienting. Light, gravity, sound, and mechanical stimuli, 
as well as temperature, chemical, and moisture gradients are all likely 
candidates. As with a moth flying into a candle, the nature of the orienting 
stimulus may be clearly apparent. However, if the animal is orienting to a 
stimulus for which humans have no receptor organs, identification of that 
stimulus will be much more difficult. Orientation to ultraviolet and polarized 
light, magnetism, electrical fields, and some acoustic stimuli are of this sort. 
Frequently, organisms respond simultaneously to several stimuli while orienting. 
Thus, one must be cautious in interpreting observations of orientation behavior 
since the stimulus most obvious to human senses may not be the most important 
factor determining the animal's behavior. Frequently an orienting stimulus also 
elicits a behavioral response. For example, in prey-catching and courtship 
behavior, the animal often first orients toward the prey or mate, then performs 
the appropriate behavior to capture the prey or attract the mate. The presence 
of the prey or potential mate in the environment causes the animal to orient 
appropriately as well as to perform other behaviors. Of course, at the same time 
that an animal is stalking prey or courting, it is also using gravity as a 
stimulus for body orientation relative to the earth. As a tuna pursues a 
mackerel in the open ocean, the mackerel elicits and orients the predatory 
behavior of the tuna, but gravity and light stimuli are also used by the tuna 
for general body orientation. </p>
<p>In addition to species differences for a given orientation behavior, the 
nature of the orienting stimulus itself may vary as a function of the animal's 
age. Many nestling birds, for example, show a gaping response which elicits 
parental feeding. When the nestlings first hatch they are blind, and the gaping 
response is released by mechanical or auditory stimuli provided by the parent 
birds. The nestlings gape vertically, with gravity being the main orienting 
stimulus. Later, after a nestling can see, the sight of the parent bird not only 
elicits the gaping response, but also orients it. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1">
<strong>Classification of Orientation Responses</strong> <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
The ways that animals orient to their environment are diverse, and certain 
schemes have been developed to classify these responses in reference to 
underlying similarities. The classification system presented in this laboratory 
was first suggested by <a href="#fraenkel">Fraenkel and Gunn (1961)</a> in their 
classic book, <em>The Orientation of Animals</em>. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
<em>Kinesis</em> <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
One important distinction that <a href="#fraenkel">Fraenkel and Gunn</a> make 
depends on whether the animal's body is oriented with respect to the stimulus 
source. A movement that does <em>not</em> involve orientation with reference to 
a stimulus source is known as a kinesis. In a kinetic response, the stimulus 
produces either a change in the speed of the animal's movement (orthokinesis) or 
in the animal's turning rate (klinokinesis). These two responses effectively 
change the position of the animal with respect to the stimulus source. Several 
examples should clarify this point. </p>
<p>Isopods (terrestrial crustaceans) prefer moist habitats. In some species, as 
the relative humidity of the environment increases, the amount of time the 
animal is stationary also increases. This response tends to keep an isopod in 
damper areas. As another example, some insects can not detect the direction of 
an odor gradient, but their rate of locomotion varies with the strength of the 
odor. Thus, if an insect moves rapidly at low concentrations of a chemical and 
slowly at high concentrations, it should eventually arrive at the source of the 
odor. The human body louse (<em>Pediculus corporis</em>) finds its host by a 
kinetic response to a number of stimuli including temperature, humidity, and 
odor. When in a favorable environment with respect to these stimuli, the louse 
travels in straight lines. However, if it encounters an unfavorable environment, 
it turns until a favorable environmental zone is once again encountered. In 
summary, a kinesis involves quantitative variations in an animal's speed or 
turning rate with no fixed orientation of the body relative to the stimulus 
source. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
<em>Taxis</em> </p>
<p>In a taxis, the animal's body is oriented in some linear manner relative to a 
stimulus; either directly toward it, directly away from it, or at a fixed angle 
to it. Locomotion may or may not be involved in a taxis. This kind of response 
may be shown for light, heat, moisture, gravity, sound, chemicals, or other 
stimuli. <br wp="br1">

<p><strong>Procedures: Investigations of Orientation Behavior</strong> </p>
</center>
<p>You will be involved in studying some aspect of the orientation behavior 
shown by one of the organisms discussed below. After making some initial 
observations, organize yourselves into small, common interest groups and, while 
consulting with your instructor, design your study. After your project has been 
approved, your group can begin collecting data to test your research hypothesis. 
After your data collection are complete, analyze data by calculating descriptive 
statistics, such as means and standard deviations, and graphing the data in 
appropriate ways. Your graphs and data tables should be transferred to overhead 
transparencies in preparation for reporting the results and conclusions to the 
class at the end of laboratory. In interpreting your results, try to relate what 
you have learned to the animal's natural environment, and consider how the 
behavior might be adaptive for the animal's way of life. In the study you do, be 
sure to collect adequate evidence <em>before</em> forming your conclusions!

<strong>Isopods</strong> <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
<em>Background Information</em> <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
These terrestrial crustaceans, sometimes called sowbugs or pillbugs, are common 
inhabitants of leaf litter and soil. They feed on decaying organic material as 
well as algae, moss, and bark. Isopods have a pair of compound eyes, two pairs 
of antennae (although only the second pair is prominent), and seven pairs of 
legs. When disturbed or desiccated they will roll up into a ball, looking rather 
pill-like. You will have access to two genera for study: <em>Porcellio</em> sp. 
(woodlice) and <em>Armadillidium</em> sp. (pillbugs). <a href="#fig1-3.gif">
Figure 1.3</a> shows the gross morphological differences between these genera.

  <li>Obtain a plastic container with individuals of either genus. Carefully 
  remove the lid and observe the location of the animals relative to the moist 
  paper towelling on the dish's bottom. How many are under the towelling? How 
  many are in the open? Remove the towelling and randomize the distribution of 
  isopods within the dish. Replace the towelling and watch how the sowbugs 
  respond. List the environmental stimuli that might be important to the animal 
  in eliciting any observed orientation behavior. <br wp="br1">
&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><br wp="br2">
<em>Suggested Studies</em> <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
A pair of modified petri dishes will be available for studies in which animals 
are given a choice between two different environments (<a href="#fig1-4.gif">Figure 
1.4</a>). This apparatus can be used to collect quantitative data on the 
response of individuals to light, humidity, or a combination of these stimuli. 
For example, to examine the possible effect of humidity on the distribution of 
individuals within the two dishes, set up the apparatus with anhydrous CaCl<sub>2</sub> 
(a desiccant) in one of the lower dishes and a wet paper towel in the other 
dish. Expose the apparatus to low, uniform illumination. After about 5 minutes 
place 10 individuals in each upper dish via the central stoppered holes. Every 
minute count the number of moving and motionless individuals in each dish. 
Continue this until your data indicate that the isopods are no longer changing 
position or moving between dishes. </p>
<p>The same approach can be used to determine if a preference is shown for light 
or dark environments. One dish can be left exposed to light and the other can be 
masked with black construction paper on top and sides. After you have gained 
some insight into the sowbug's response to humidity and illumination (and have 
collected enough data to support your views!), you can examine the interplay 
between these two stimulus types. Is the response to humidity changed under 
conditions of high illumination? What if the individuals are offered a brightly 
illuminated, humid environment versus a dark, dry environment? </p>

</blockquote>
<p>To better understand the orientation response of isopods, examine the 
response of individuals within the apparatus. Place one animal in the apparatus 
and track its progress by marking its path with a pen. Continue this for 4­5 
minutes. Use a map measurer to find (1) the total distance travelled in both 
environments, and (2) the total distances in the two halves of &quot;direct&quot; travel 
(i.e., maintaining a straight line or following the dish's curve). Also, count 
the number of sharp curves of more than 90<sup>o</sup>. Do your data indicate 
whether the response shown is a kinesis or a taxis? If a taxis is involved, what 
would you do to determine the taxis type? (The various kinds of taxes are 
described at the end of this outline.) </p>
<p>Additional Background Information:</p>
<center>
<p><b><strong>Classification of Taxis Types</strong> </b></p>
</center>
<p>Taxes (singular taxis) have been classified by <a href="#fraenkel">Fraenkel 
and Gunn (1961)</a> according to (1) the type of stimulus eliciting a response 
and (2) how the organism accomplishes the orientation. For example, the response 
would be termed phototaxis if the stimulus were light, geotaxis if the stimulus 
were gravity, and chemotaxis if the response involved a chemical stimulus. To be 
even more precise, since the organism is orienting toward the light, its 
response may be described as a <strong>positive phototaxis</strong>. Use the 
data you have collected to characterize the behavior of your organisms. Do they 
show a kinesis, a taxis, or both? Try to be as precise as possible when 
describing the orientation response of your study organism. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
&nbsp;</p>
<p>One type of taxis is dependent on bilaterally symmetrical receptor organs. 
The animal orients either directly toward or directly away from the stimulus 
source by positioning itself with reference to the stimulus such that both 
organs are receiving equal stimulation. If the animal is locomoting, it moves 
directly toward or away from the stimulus source. This type of orientation can 
be recognized in two ways, as exemplified by the isopod <em>Armadillidium</em> 
(see <a href="#fig1-8.gif">Figure 1.8</a>). Under certain conditions, this 
animal is photopositive and will move toward a light source by orienting so that 
its bilateral photoreceptors are equally stimulated. If blinded in one eye and 
then exposed to diffuse light, it will continuously attempt to equalize 
stimulation. The circling movements of unilaterally-blinded animals are 
characteristic of a taxis dependent on bilateral photoreceptors. Also, if <em>
Armadillidium</em> is offered two light sources of equal intensity, it will 
advance to a point equally distant between them before turning toward either the 
right or the left. It should be noted that pillbugs are not always positively 
phototactic. The positive response appears particularly after a sudden rise in 
temperature, or a period of starvation or desiccation. What adaptive 
significance might this variability in response to stimuli have for a 
terrestrial animal? <br wp="br1">

  photoreceptors of the pillbug, <em>Armadillidium</em> sp., under different 
  conditions. X = starting point; = location of pillbug. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <strong>dorsal light reaction </strong>is another important form of a 
taxis dependent on bilateral receptor organs that is exhibited by many aerial 
and aquatic organisms. This reaction functions to keep the animal's dorsal 
surface uppermost and oriented toward the natural light source. Again, this is 
accomplished by maintaining equal stimulation of bilateral photoreceptor organs.
<em>Argulus</em>, a marine crustacean, normally swims with its dorsal surface 
toward light. In a natural situation, the light always comes from above. 
However, if an artificial light is presented from below, the animal will swim 
about upside-down. If one eye is removed, it makes the characteristic continuous 
circling movements. </p>
<p>Many fish show the dorsal light reaction, but in most it is modified by 
information on gravity detected by the labyrinth organ of the inner ear. Thus, 
the orientation of labyrinthectomized fish is determined only by the position of 
the light, whereas normal intact fish orient using both the direction of light 
and the pull of gravity (Figure 1.9). See the demonstration of the dorsal light 
reaction in angel fish. <br wp="br1">

  direction of light beams. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some animals with but a single receptor organ can still show a taxis movement 
either directly toward or away from a stimulus source. In this case, the animal 
first turns its single receptor one way, then the other way, determining in this 
manner the direction in which the stimulus source is strongest. Certain fly 
larvae show this form of orientation during the period preceding pupation. 
Larvae are photonegative and thus seek out dark areas. They do this by turning 
their head (where the light receptor is located) first in one direction, then 
the other. Based on this information, the animal advances in the direction of 
least light. This type of taxis is most common in orientation to chemicals, as 
in the food finding behavior of planaria, and is characterized by the 
side-to-side movement of the animal's forebody during locomotion. </p>
<p>In another type of taxis, known as <strong>goal-directed orientation</strong>, 
the animal orients directly toward or away from the stimulus source even if one 
receptor organ of a pair is removed (the animals do not show circling 
movements). Moreover, if presented with two equally intense stimuli the animal 
does not pursue an intermediate path, but rather aims directly at either source, 
in some way disregarding the other. This suggests that the animal is not 
orienting by equalizing the stimulation intensity on the two sides of the body, 
but rather perceives the stimulus as a discrete goal. </p>
<p>Examples of goal-directed orientation are many and include the orientation of 
the nestling gaping response toward the parent bird's head, the positioning of 
toads towards their prey prior to striking, and the photopositive response of 
hermit crabs (see Figure 1.10). <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>

  presented with two light sources. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Considered by some to be a special type of goal-directed orientation, <strong>
light-compass orientation</strong> is found in many insects and vertebrates. 
Light-compass orientation involves orientation at a constant angle with respect 
to a light source, such as the sun or moon, and enables the animal to obtain 
compass information while moving through unfamiliar territory. Changing the 
apparent position of the celestial body with a mirror results in a predictable 
change in the animal's orientation. A time sense is necessary in order to 
compensate for the sun's apparent movement across the sky. </p>
<p>A moth flying into a candle is showing light-compass orientation that has 
gone awry. As with many nocturnal insects, the moth tends to fly at a fixed 
angle relative to the moon. However, with a nearby light source, such as a 
candle, as the moth moves it must constantly change its flight path in order to 
maintain a fixed angle relative to the light. The closer it gets to the light 
source, the more curved its flight path becomes. This results in the 
characteristic spiralling flight into the flame. </p>
<p>Orientation can also be based on memory (sometimes called <strong>landmark 
orientation</strong>), where the animal learns the prominent features of its 
environment and uses this &quot;stored&quot; information to guide its future movement. 
This type of taxis is certainly common in vertebrates, many of which learn the 
&quot;lay of the land&quot; in the areas where they spend much of their time. Some 
invertebrates, such as the solitary sand wasps, use landmarks to find their 
nests (<a href="#tinbergen">Tinbergen, 1958</a>). </p>
<p>The mechanisms underlying taxes are often complex and depend on the 
morphological and physiological characteristics of the organism. Furthermore, 
these forms of behavior are not as rigid as is sometimes assumed. For example, 
the response of an animal to light may be changed or strengthened according to 
whether it is hungry or satiated, desiccated or has had access to water, or 
whether it has most recently been in the dark or not. In addition, it is 
biologically important for animals to be released occasionally from behavioral 
responses which would otherwise trap them. Woodlice (<em>Porcellio</em> sp.) 
clustered under bark in darkness and relatively high humidity must emerge at 
some time to feed. It is not surprising to find, therefore, that as the 
temperature drops in the evening their positive-humidity response weakens, and 
they emerge to run about and feed. </p>
<p>You should also recognize that a species may possess several different 
orientation responses, even those involving the same sensory receptors. Grayling 
butterflies (<em>Eumenis</em> <em>semele</em>), for example, will fly into the 
sun to escape predators. This response is dependent on paired photoreceptors 
because, if blinded in one eye, the butterfly will perform circling movements. 
However, during courtship males fly after females and are also guided primarily 
by optical stimuli; yet, because they can still do this if unilaterally blinded, 
the mechanisms controlling the two responses must be different. </p>
