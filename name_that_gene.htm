<h4>Name That Gene </h4>
<p>(adopted from Weber, S.<u> The American Biology Teacher</u>, Volume 65, 
October 2003)</p>
<p>Answer the following questions in complete sentences:</p>
<p>1. What are the 4 nucleotides that make up a DNA code? What are their common 
abbreviations?</p>
<p>2. What does DNA code for? </p>
<p>3. What is a gene? Where/how do we find genes?</p>
<p>4. Where are genes located?</p>
<p>5. Explain DNA determines the traits of an organism? Use the words 
nucleotides, gene and protein in your answer.</p>
<p>6. What do you think can cause a genetic disease?</p>
<p>7. What will happen to an organism's health is a gene for an important 
protein is defective?</p>
<p>8. What would happen if an organism inherited a gene that coded for defective 
proteins?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Directions for the Name that Gene Activity:</p>
<p>In the following exercise you will be given nucleotide sequences found in 
real human DNA that are associated with genetic disorders when mutated. Your job 
is to compare the sequences you are given with the nucleotide sequences of most 
known genes. Using a search engine for genetic databases, you will be able to; 
a) name the gene that contains the short DNA sequence that you are 
investigating, b) locate the gene on its corresponding chromosome, and c) 
describe the disorder that results when that gene is defective.</p>
<p>Protocol for retrieving gene sequences:</p>
<p>1. Connect to the internet. Go to <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov">
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a> (National Center for Biological Information). 
Click the word BLAST on the top blue bar. or go to </p>
<table id="program">
  <tbody><tr class="odd">
    <td class="link">
    <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/Blast.cgi?PAGE=Nucleotides&amp;PROGRAM=blastn&amp;MEGABLAST=on&amp;BLAST_PROGRAMS=megaBlast&amp;PAGE_TYPE=BlastSearch&amp;SHOW_DEFAULTS=on">
    nucleotide blast</a></td>
    <td class="desc">Search a <strong>nucleotide</strong> database using a
    <strong>nucleotide</strong> query<br>
    <span class="inc"><em>Algorithms:</em> blastn, megablast, discontiguous 
    megablast</span></td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>2. Locate the heading "Nucleotide-nucleotide BLAST" and click on that word.</p>
<p>3. Type in only ONE of the exact nucleotide sequences (listed in the next 
section of this activity) in the top box of the window. Click BLAST.</p>
<p>4. On the next screen that shows up,  and then you will have 
to wait until the search engine finds looking for your sequence. (or just look 
down lower on the page).</p>
<p>5. When the search finishes, scroll down the screen until you find
the start of the list showing the most relevant finds. Note the name of
the gene on the first blue line. Then click on the first blue reference
line. This will tell you the name of the gene and location on a
chromosome if that information is available. Once you have identified
your gene return to the first screen at NCBI. (write down the name of
the gene and what chromosome #1-23 the gene is located on).</p>
<p>6. Located on the top of the screen (you may need to scroll down the drop down menu) is 
OMIM (online Mendelian inheritance in Man) on the top right drop 
down menu "SEARCH" and then paste the name of the gene into "FOR" box and then search.</p>
<p>7. Click on the first return and that goes to the explanation of the
gene. Look down the reference until you find what diseases are
associated with this gene. (usually under the topic heading of
Molecular Genetics).</p>
<p>8. Do an internet search or find the "<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK22183/">Gene and Disease</a>"
site on the NCBI site (note the NCBI site changes and you may have to
do a search for Gene and Disease) to answer the following questions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) What causes the disorder/disease you searched for?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) Are there any treatments?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3) How is the disorder/disease inherited?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
