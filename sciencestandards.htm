      <td vAlign="top" align="left" width="520">1. Scientific progress is made 
      by asking meaningful questions and conducting careful investigations. As a 
      basis for understanding this concept and addressing the content in the 
      other four strands, students should develop their own questions and 
      perform investigations. Students will:
      <p>a. Select and use appropriate tools and technology (such as 
      computer-linked probes, spreadsheets, and graphing calculators) to perform 
      tests, collect data, analyze relationships, and display data. </p>
      <p>b. Identify and communicate sources of unavoidable experimental error.<br>
      <br>
      c. Identify possible reasons for inconsistent results, such as sources of 
      error or uncontrolled conditions. </p>
      <p>d. Formulate explanations by using logic and evidence.<br>
      <br>
      e. Solve scientific problems by using quadratic equations and simple 
      trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions. </p>
      <p>f. Distinguish between hypothesis and theory as scientific terms.<br>
      <br>
      g. Recognize the usefulness and limitations of models and theories as 
      scientific representations of reality. </p>
      <p>h. Read and interpret topographic and geologic maps.<br>
      <br>
      i. Analyze the locations, sequences, or time intervals that are 
      characteristic of natural phenomena (e.g., relative ages of rocks, 
      locations of planets over time, and succession of species in an 
      ecosystem). </p>
      <p>j. Recognize the issues of statistical variability and the need for 
      controlled tests.<br>
      <br>
      k. Recognize the cumulative nature of scientific evidence.<br>
      <br>
      l. Analyze situations and solve problems that require combining and 
      applying concepts from more than one area of science. </p>
      <p>m. Investigate a science-based societal issue by researching the 
      literature, analyzing data, and communicating the findings. Examples of 
      issues include irradiation of food, cloning of animals by somatic cell 
      nuclear transfer, choice of energy sources, and land and water use 
      decisions in California. </p>
      <p>n. Know that when an observation does not agree with an accepted 
      scientific theory, the observation is sometimes mistaken or fraudulent (e. 
      g., the Piltdown Man fossil or unidentified flying objects) and that the 
      theory is sometimes wrong (e.g., the Ptolemaic model of the movement of 
      the Sun, Moon, and planets). </td>
