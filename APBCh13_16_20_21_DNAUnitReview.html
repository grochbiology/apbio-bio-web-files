<P>Chapter 16, 20, 21 Review Guide<BR><BR><BR>Chargaff&rsquo;s rules
(base-pairing rules)<BR>Structure of DNA, purpose of histones
<BR>Purposes of the enzymes of DNA replication, what is required for
replication <BR>The differences between the leading and lagging
strands during DNA replication<BR>Know the complimentary base pair
rules to make a mRNA or primer from a DNA template<BR>What is a
telomere? What does telomerase do?<BR>Meselson Stahl, Hershey Chase
experiment<BR>How to insert a gene into a plasmid, how restriction
enzymes work<BR>Why use model organisms (worms,flies,bacteria) for
studying genomes instead of human only. 
</P>
<P>What is the purpose of gene therapy? Why haven't we figured out
how to do it well?<BR>How Dolly the sheep was cloned.<BR>How genetic
engineering is used by the pharmaceutical industry.<BR>How DNA
fragments run in an electrophoresis gel (the order in which they
sort).<BR>Use a electrophoresis gel to tell the relationships between
individuals&nbsp; (paternity, crime, etc).<BR>What is bioinformatics,
what is sequencing good for?</P>
<P>Is there a relationship between the size of an organism and it's
genome size?</P>
<P>What are pseudogenes and what are they good for?<BR>Looking at the
chromosomes of different animals, why are the genes in different
locations?<BR>Where are restriction enzymes found? What is the
&ldquo;natural&rdquo; purpose of restriction enzymes? How do
restriction enzymes work? 
</P>
<P> How can you assemble a plasmid using a restriction enzyme that
makes a sticky end cut?</P>
<P>How does recombinant DNA work? (Example, <I>E. coli</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">
and pGlo) Why do scientists use antibiotic genes in combination with
the gene of interest (glowing jellyfish gene)?</SPAN></P>
<P>Transgenic plants be used to create human proteins, are there any
potential issues with using transgenic organisms?</P>
<P>What is the difference between metacentric and acrocentric
chomosomes?</P>

evidence and HOW did that evidence help Watson and Crick deduce the
structure of DNA?<BR>What is the relationship and purpose of homeotic
genes and homeobox sequence?<BR>What are the various ways that
chromosomes exchange blocks of DNA?</P>
