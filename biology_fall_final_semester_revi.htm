<p>Biology Fall Final Semester Review Information: <font color="#ff0000">(Items 
in red are NOT on this year's fall final exam)</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chapters include: Chapter 1,2, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, parts of 13,18, 19, <span style="color: red;">35.1 ,37</span>,<font color="#ff0000">39</font> 
(see the calendar)</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Look through your logbook.</p>
<p>2. Go over your reading notes notes.</p>
<p>3. Review the labs</p>
<p>4. Re-read the chapter summaries, re-read the captions on figures in the 
chapters.</p>
<p>5. Prepare a handwritten 3 x 5 inch card, both sides, with the most important 
information, or information you have trouble memorizing.</p>
<p>There will be up to 100 questions and one essay. Remember the essay will only be 
read if your semester grade is on the borderline within 0.5% of the next higher 
letter grade.</p>
