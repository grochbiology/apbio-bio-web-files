R. in TROUBLE!</P><P>Background:  The big job of the kidney is to maintain(homeostasis), chemical equilibrium, of the body, by filtering theblood that circulates through it.  The Kidney converts what's leftover into urine.  About 2000 L of blood pass through both kidneys aday, yet only 1.5 -2 L exit.  That contains all of the liquid wastethat needs to be eliminated. </P><P>Scenario:</P><P>You are a clinical technician (lab tech).  Several urine sampleshave arrived at the laboratory and the labels have become separatedfrom the samples.  You have the patient's names and probablediagnosis on the labels.  Design an experiment to match the unknownsamples with their owners.</P><P>Patient #: 			Symptoms</P><table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" width="83%" id="AutoNumber1">  <tr>    <td width="15%">    <p align="center">Patient #</td>    <td width="85%">&nbsp;Symptoms</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width="15%" align="center">A</td>    <td width="85%">excessive urination, thirst, wounds that don't heal, sweet     smelling urine</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width="15%" align="center">B</td>    <td width="85%">skin has a 				yellow tint, sclera of eyes has     yellow tint</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width="15%" align="center">C</td>    <td width="85%">trouble urinating, back pain</td>  </tr></table><P>The doctors have listed the following possible diseases:   Anemia, Diabetes, Jaundice- Liver Damage, Kidney Damage, Bladder Infection</P><P>Laboratory Tests:</P><table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" width="84%" id="AutoNumber2">  <tr>    <td width="16%">Test</td>    <td width="16%">Indicator used to test urine</td>    <td width="84%">Normal ranges and other information</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width="16%">pH</td>    <td width="16%">pH paper</td>    <td width="84%">normal: slightly acidic (~pH 6.8-7.0), below ph6.8 suggests     acidosis, diabetes, kidney disease, heart disease, excessive     diarrhea</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width="16%">protein</td>    <td width="16%">Biurets</td>    <td width="84%">detects the presence of nitrogen, sign of using protein for     energy, kidney damage</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width="16%">glucose</td>    <td width="16%">glucose test strips</td>    <td width="84%">diabetes</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width="16%">broken blood cells</td>    <td width="16%">color</td>    <td width="84%">&nbsp;liver disease (detected by red or brownish     color) or presence of RBC kidney damage</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width="16%">specific gravity</td>    <td width="16%">urinometer- or called hydrometers</td>    <td width="84%">Detects kidney failure: above 1.025 excessive salt being     excreted) (normal range is 1.010 to 1.025) </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width="16%">Bile</td>    <td width="16%">shaking test-tube</td>    <td width="84%">if present shows starvation, liver damage,detected by&nbsp;and seeing if urine forms bubbles</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width="16%">RBC:</td>    <td width="16%">slide examination (preprepared)</td>    <td width="84%">presence of RBC (broken glomeruli; high blood pressure,     mechanical damage to kidney) or WBC (infection)</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width="16%">salt crystals</td>    <td width="16%">slide examination (preprepared)</td>    <td width="84%">crystals present; kidney stones or kidney damage</td>  </tr></table><P><b>Prelab:</b></P><P>1.

Using an outside source, i.e.. internet, medical dictionary,&nbsp; (NOTE: if you copy and paste information you will receive a ZERO on this assignment) use your own words and define all technical vocabulary and reference everything you use. Make sure you remember to avoid all&nbsp; pronouns, make sure if you use the word &quot;this&quot; a noun generally follows; example &quot;This result...&quot;.&nbsp; You will create 3 paragraphs (one for each patient).</P><P>A.&nbsp;<b><u>list </u></b>the major symptoms of each diagnosed disease (in sentences).</P><P>B.&nbsp; <u><b>explain</b></u> (in your own words and using no pronouns) why the lab tests are appropriate or indicate the presence of one of the conditions</P><P>C.&nbsp; <u><b>explain</b></u> what are the recommendations for treatment of that condition (in your own words with no pronouns). Also make sure that all scientific terminology is explained after you first use the word.... example &quot;urinalysis (a test of substances found in urine)<sup>2</sup> (note the superscript 2 for the reference).</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>Potentially Helpful Web Links:</P><P><a href="http://kidneydiseases.about.com/od/urinalysis/a/Article0052.htm">http://kidneydiseases.about.com/od/urinalysis/a/Article0052.htm</a> </P><P><a href="http://kidneydiseases.about.com/od/symptomssigns/a/Article0004.htm">http://kidneydiseases.about.com/od/symptomssigns/a/Article0004.htm</a> </P><P><a href="http://kidneydiseases.about.com/od/dialysis/a/anemiawarning.htm">http://kidneydiseases.about.com/od/dialysis/a/anemiawarning.htm</a> </P><P><a href="http://diabetes.about.com/od/whatisdiabetes/p/type1diabetes.htm">http://diabetes.about.com/od/whatisdiabetes/p/type1diabetes.htm</a> </P><P><a href="http://diabetes.about.com/od/whatisdiabetes/qt/type2diabetes.htm">http://diabetes.about.com/od/whatisdiabetes/qt/type2diabetes.htm</a> </P><P><a href="http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/diseases/facts/jaundice.htm">http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/diseases/facts/jaundice.htm</a> </P><P>&nbsp;</P></BODY></HTML>
