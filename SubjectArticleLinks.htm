<h3 id="story9">A Recipe for &quot;Protolife&quot;?</h3>
<p>The earliest forms of &quot;protolife&quot; on Earth must have been able to reproduce 
and replicate, and it is likely that they were also cellular. But how did these 
primitive compartments come to be? In a report in the 31 Oct 2003 <i>Science</i>, 
Hanczyc et al. (<a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/302/5645/618">http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/302/5645/618</a>) 
presented an experimental model of the primordial conditions that may have 
spawned life. They showed that clay particles can catalyze the formation of 
lipid vesicles in water. These same particles also adsorb RNA, and when forced 
to divide (by filtration through small pores), distribute the RNA into daughter 
vesicles. The chemical energy needed to drive vesicle formation in this system 
derived from a decrease in pH and the subsequent phase change in the lipids from 
micelles to bilayer membrane. The experiments thus demonstrate that vesicle 
growth and division can result from simple physicochemical forces, without any 
complex biochemical machinery. Similar conditions may have existed in porous 
mounds of clay and other minerals on the ancient ocean floor, where alkaline 
seepage from hydrothermal sources could have provided the necessary inputs of 
material and energy for life to take form. Although there is no evidence that 
natural lipids would have been present in sufficient quantities, amino acids 
could have easily joined together as polypeptides to form the first organic 
membranes. A Perspective by M. J. Russell (<a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/302/5645/580">http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/302/5645/580</a>)

<h3 id="story14">Ozone Depletion and Antarctic Climate</h3>
<p>Much attention has been paid to the influence of increased greenhouse gas 
concentrations on global climate, but human-induced ozone depletion has also 
been implicated in affecting climate change. In a report in <i>Science</i> last 
year (3 May 2002, p. 895), Thompson and Solomon argued that seasonal 
stratospheric ozone depletion over Antarctica was affecting weather in the lower 
atmosphere (troposphere) and was at least partly responsible for the observed 
climate warming and strengthening of westerly winds encircling the southern 
polar cap. A report by Gillett and Thompson (<a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/302/5643/273">http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/302/5643/273</a>) 
in the 10 Oct 2003 <i>Science</i> has now provided strong evidence to support 
that hypothesis. The researchers presented modeling data on the seasonality, 
spatial structure, and amplitude of high-latitude climate change in the Southern 
Hemisphere and showed that the observed changes in spring and summer can indeed 
be explained as a response to human-induced Antarctic ozone depletion. As noted 
in an accompanying Perspective by D. J. Karoly (<a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/302/5643/236">http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/302/5643/236</a>), 
it is the first modeling study to show quantitative agreement between climate 
variability at Earth's surface and ozone depletion in the stratosphere. Still, 
recent climate change in the Southern Hemisphere has likely resulted from a 
combination of natural and human influences, and untangling the separate 
contributions will be a crucial next step toward predicting how climate may 
change in the future.</p>

<p>In recent years, our understanding of the basic mechanisms underlying brain 
diseases has grown tremendously. The 31 Oct 2003 <i>Science</i> explored some of 
the field's most exciting developments -- and the prospects for future 
prevention and therapy. Review and Viewpoint articles examined the state of our 
knowledge of Parkinson's disease, the genetic complexities underlying many 
neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders (and the promise of new 
techniques for early detection and treatment), the havoc caused by misfolded 
proteins in Alzheimer's disease and prion disorders, and updates to our 
understanding of two postnatal developmental disorders in young children, autism 
and Rett syndrome. News stories focused on efforts by psychiatrists to overhaul 
their current scheme for diagnosing mental illness to incorporate input from the 
fields of genetics, neuroscience, and behavioral science; and on hopeful new 
strategies for treating depression, despite researchers' still incomplete 
understanding of the disease's biology. In addition, research papers in the same 
issue provided new insight into the molecular underpinnings of prion disease, 
Rett syndrome, and Parkinson's disease. </p>
<p>Online, articles at Science's STKE (<a href="http://stke.sciencemag.org/misc/scifeatured/SciRelatedArticles.dtl">http://stke.sciencemag.org/misc/scifeatured/SciRelatedArticles.dtl</a>) 
discussed the contributions of neurotransmitter transporters in psychiatric 
disorders, the possible role of the phosphatase calcineurin in schizophrenia, 
and evidence for the signaling functions of huntingtin -- a protein altered in 
Huntington's disease. A case study detailed on Science's SAGE KE (<a href="http://sageke.sciencemag.org/">http://sageke.sciencemag.org/</a>) 
offered further insight into Huntington's disease with pathology slides and a 
movie of a patient's neurological testing. And a special <i>Science</i> Online 
Web supplement (<a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/sciext/braindisease/">http://www.sciencemag.org/sciext/braindisease/</a>) 
offered links to additional resources and articles on the diseases explored in 
the special issue. </p>

<h4>Researchers Define Molecular Basis of Human &quot;Sweet Tooth&quot; and Umami Taste</h4>
<p>Halloween turns millions of kids into candy-loving monsters with more than 
ample supply of confections to satisfy their &quot;sweet tooth.&quot; Now, HHMI 
researchers have moved closer to understanding why some people cannot resist the 
impulses brought on by sweets.</p>
<p>The researchers created mice with the same sweet-tooth preferences as humans 
by inserting the gene that codes for a human sweet-taste receptor protein into 
the animals. They also inserted an entirely different receptor gene into the 
taste cells of mice, thereby producing animals that perceive a previously 
tasteless molecule as sweet.<font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2"><font SIZE="2">For
