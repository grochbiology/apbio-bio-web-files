</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS" SIZE=2><P>(Adapted from Maier, C.A. (2001) “Building Phylogenetic Trees from DNA Sequence Data: Investigating Polar Bear &amp; Giant Panda Ancestry.” <I>The American Biology Teacher.</I> 63:9, Pages642-646.)</P>

<P>Introduction:</P>
<P>This activity will allow you to use the tools used by geneticists and evolutionists located and maintained by the National Center for Biotechnology Information. These tools will allow you to compare the isolated and sequenced genes from species that are stored in GenBank. Each unique sequence is identified by an “accession number” as unique as your social security number. You will also be able to compare sequences and generate phylogenetic trees using Biology Workbench that contains specific application such as CLUSTALW (sequence similarity tool), CLUSTALDIST (generates a genetic distance matrix) and DRAWGRAM (creates phylogenetic trees).  The gene sequence that is being used in this activity is the 12s ribosomal RNA gene sequence from several bear species and the giant panda. The 12s gene is a good candidate for study because it doesn’t undergo recombination (not subject to meiosis) because the gene is found on the mitochondrial chromosome* which is inherited only from the mother via the egg. </P>
<P>* Check out this link for a discussion of the use of mitochondrial DNA and if it really is only from the mother. </FONT><B><I><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS" SIZE=2 COLOR="#00007f">Athena Review †Vol.2, no.2</B></I>: <I>†Recent Finds in Paleoanthropology</I>  <B>&nbsp;Molecular clockwork and related theories</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=6 COLOR="#00007f"><B> </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS" SIZE=2>

<P><u>PART 1:</u></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>a. Open a new web page or new tab and Enter: 
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a></P>

</TABLE>

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
<P>e. Find the bar with “GenBank” to the right of the “Display” use the drop 
down menu and select &quot;FASTA&quot; to bring up the sequence in FASTA format.</P>
<P>f. Open a new web page or new tab so you can toggle between the two pages and 
go to: <a href="http://workbench.sdsc.edu">http://workbench.sdsc.edu</a>, set up 
a free account, then enter Workbench 3.2</P>
<P>g. To import the sequence into Biology Workbench, highlight the entire FASTA sequence (including the “&gt;”). Copy the highlighted sequence.</P>
<P>i. Select “nucleic tools”, then select “add new nucleic sequence” located on the bottom of the 
window.</P>
<P>j. In the “label” box, (lower down the page), type in the type of bear.</P>
<P>k. Position the cursor in the top left of the sequence box and “Paste” the sequence. You will need to replace the FASTA description with the name of the bear, making sure the “&gt;” 
symbol is still the first symbol, MAKE SURE THERE ARE NO SPACES AFTER THE &quot;&gt;&quot; 
AND NO SPACES BETWEEN THE NAME OF THE BEAR LEAVE ONE SPACE AFTER THE NAME OR THE 
PROGRAM GETS CONFUSED. The program sees the nucleotide sequence immediately 
following the first space. Select “SAVE”.</P>
<P>l.  Return to GenBank (on the other web page). Copy and Paste the remaining 12s rRNA gene sequences into the Workbench</P>

<P><u>Instructions Part II: Analyze the 12s rRNA Gene Sequences</u></P>

</FONT>

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>
<P>1. <u>Align the five different Bear 12s rRNA Gene Sequences (not the panda)</u></P>
<P>a. In Biology Workbench, select “nucleic tools” and select (check the boxes) the five bears (not the panda yet). </P>
<P>b. From the nucleic tools menu box, choose “CLUSTALW” (located in the bottom 
of the window), then click &quot;run&quot;&nbsp; then click &quot;submit&quot;. A window will come back and then click on “import alignment” to enter the Alignment Tools section of the Workbench. 
NOTE: Make sure the window has completely loaded before clicking import 
alignment or the program will default back to the first page.</P>

<P>2. <u>Determine the Genetic Distance Between Sequence Pairs</u></P>
<P>a. Click (to check) on the box to the left of the aligned sequences (note: 
there may be a few choices, just click one), then choose :CLUSTALDIST”,&nbsp; 
and “submit” Record the distance matrix (located lower on the page) in your 
journal to examine later. (NOTE: If you get lost you can always click &quot;return&quot; 
to get back to the beginning or click &quot;nucleic tools&quot; to get all the way back to 
the sequence lists.</P>

<P>3. <u>Build a Phylogenetic Tree of the Bear Species</u></P>
<P>a. From the Alignment Tools Menu, choose “DRAWGRAM” located at the bottom of 
the window,&nbsp; and “submit” on the next screen when it loads. Scroll down to 
find the diagram.&nbsp; Record the diagram in your journal.</P>

<P>4. D<u>etermine the relationship of Giant Panda to the Bear Phylogenetic Tree</u></P>
<P>a. In GenBank (if you haven’t already) access the giant panda 12s rRNA gene sequence and import it into the Biology Workbench, if you have already just add a check in the box next to the list on the page in Workbench.</P>
<P>b. Run a new alignment with all five bears and the panda sequence. Import the alignment into Alignment tools, use “CLUSTALDIST” to create a distance matrix and “DRAWGRAM” to do the tree. Record all information.</P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS" SIZE=2><P>Analysis: (due typed)</P>
<P>1. Create a table showing the distance matrix of the five bears and the panda (Please note that a distance of 0.00 indicates identical sequences and as the difference in gene sequences increases so does the number).</P>

<P>2. Provide a phylogenetic tree of the bears and the panda. Label the lines on the tree with the corresponding distances.</P>

<P>3.  Explain and provide support for the conclusions made by the program (Biology Workbench). </P>

<P>4. Red Panda are reported to be more closely related to raccoon. Find the relationship (provide both the distance matrix and tree) between the Red Panda and raccoons to the others you’ve already examined. Is the first statement supported?</P>

<P>5. Pick a few animals and run their 12s rRNA patterns to see how they are 
related. Record this information.</P></FONT></BODY>
