<p class="MsoNormal">How to Write an Abstract/ Examples of Abstracts/</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Lab abstract should be no more than 200 words.&nbsp;&nbsp;IN A 
CONCISE, CONVERSATIONAL,3rd person manner.&nbsp; It is written in past tense and 
should catch the readers’ attention.&nbsp; A person reading it...your teacher, a 
science fair judge, or your classmates should be able to easily understand what 
was going on as well as the outcome in the lab.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a summary of the basic 
content of the experiment. It should state the purpose of the experiment, 
mention the techniques used, report results obtained, and give conclusions. The 
point of the abstract is to give a concise summary of the whole report. The most 
common mistake that students make is not including summary data. Example:</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Comic Sans MS">Chromosomal DNA was 
successfully isolated from Bacillus subtilis strain 151 using a modification of 
the Marmur technique. Spectrophotometric analysis revealed some contamination 
with protein, but little RNA contamination. The pure DNA had a concentration of 
1.05 mg/ml with a 10.3 mg total yield. The DNA was sterile, as judged by 
streaking onto penassay agar.<O:P> </O:P>

<b>The purpose of this experiment was to demonstrate movement of water or sugar 
molecules into or out of cell membranes.&nbsp; The sub-purpose was to determine how 
much sugar and water are in a carrot.&nbsp; The hypothesis states that if carrots are 
placed in a varying amounts of sucrose solution then the mass of the carrots 
will change.&nbsp; The null hypothesis states that if the carrots are placed in 
varying amounts of sucrose solution then the carrot mass will not change.&nbsp; The 
carrots were peeled, sliced and massed before placing them in the beakers with 
various sucrose solutions ranging from 0%, 7%, 14%, 21% 28% and 35%.&nbsp; After 24 
hours of soaking the carrot slices were removed, briefly blotted to remove 
solution clinging to the outsides, and re-massed.&nbsp; The carrots in the 0% sucrose 
solution gained .4 gms, in 7% solution gained .1 gms, in 14% solution lost .2 
gms, in 21% solution lost .42 gms, in 28% solution lost .52 gms and in 35% 
solution lost .66 gms.&nbsp; It can be concluded that the hypothesis was supported 
and that the carrots that gained weight have a sucrose % greater than the 
solution in which they were soaking, making them hypertonic to the solution, 
whereas the carrots that lost mass were hypotonic to the solution in which they 
were soaking; therefore have less sucrose than the solution.&nbsp; </b></p>

<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>The goal of the lab was to calculate the speed of sow bugs.&nbsp; The 
hypothesis stated that if the sow bug is allowed to travel at an uninterrupted 
pace then the speed of the sow bug can be calculated at about one half a mile 
per hour. <i>The null hypothesis is that the sow bug’s speed cannot be 
calculated because it is not a constant speed.</i>&nbsp; To figure out the speed of 
the sow bug, the bug was placed on a grooved ruler with a sheet of clear plastic 
over the top to prevent the bugs escape.&nbsp; The bug was then timed on how long it 
took it to travel the length of the ruler using a stopwatch.&nbsp; This procedure was 
repeated ten times to get the most accurate results.&nbsp; The data was then 
converted to miles per hour (m.p.h.) and the average speed was calculated.&nbsp; The 
average time it took the sow bug to travel 12 inches was 14.513 seconds, or an 
average of 0.109 miles per hour.&nbsp; This is extremely slow.&nbsp; The data does not 
support the hypothesis, but rather supports the null hypothesis.&nbsp; It was 
learned, though, how fast a sow bug travels, which was the objective of the 
lab.&nbsp; It can be concluded from this lab that it would take a sow bug a very long 
time to travel one mile.<O:P> </O:P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The purpose of this investigation was to determine which types of 
plants and their parts could be used as pH indicators.&nbsp; It was hypothesized that 
if the pigmentation of a purple azalea flower petals was subjected to different 
standardized pH solutions, then the petal’s pigment would turn different colors 
depending upon the pH of the solution being tested.&nbsp; The null hypothesis is that 
the plant’s parts will not respond to any of the standardized pH solutions. &nbsp;The 
pH 1-14 standards were produced by a serial dilution using two starting pH 
solutions of 1 and 14 and distilled water.&nbsp; The azalea petals were soaked in 
isopropyl alcohol to extract any visible pigment.&nbsp; Using a spot plate, each pH 
standard was placed in a numbered spot and two drops of the azalea petal extract 
was added.&nbsp; The resulting colors were recorded ranging from light pink in a pH 1 
spot to a deep blue in a pH 14 spot.&nbsp; To determine the validity of the pH test, 
each of the pH standard spots were tested with pH paper.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the colors 
changed, when the flower petal pigments were subjected to each of the different 
pH standard solutions, the hypothesis was supported by the data.&nbsp;</p>

<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>This experiment uses plant pigments and tests them to see if they 
are good pH indicators.&nbsp; The hypothesis was that if a carrots pigment were 
removed and tested with a range of pH solutions, then it would prove to be a 
good pH indicator<b>.&nbsp; </b>The null hypothesis is that the carrot pigment will 
remain unchanged when tested with the various pH solutions, therefore indicating 
that the carrot’s pigments are not good pH indicators.&nbsp; Isopropyl alcohol was 
used to extract pigment from two grams of ground up carrot.&nbsp; The pigment was 
yellow.&nbsp; Then, using 14 numbered test tubes; 9ml of distilled water was put in 
all test tubes except one and 14.&nbsp; In number one,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10ml of HCl was 
put in, and 10 ml of NaOH was put in number 14.&nbsp; Then a serial dilution was 
performed going from one to six and then 14 to 8.&nbsp; This provided pH solutions 
ranging from a pH of one to a pH of 14.&nbsp; Then a spot plate was numbered and a 
few drops from each numbered test tube were put in the corresponding spot on the 
spot plate.&nbsp; Next, a few drops of the carrot pigment were placed in each spot of 
the spot plate.&nbsp; The color change was then observed.&nbsp; This experiment supported 
the null hypothesis because the experiment showed that a carrot is not a good pH 
indicator.&nbsp; All of the solutions in each spot plate remained yellow.

<p><i>Point of View</i> – The point of view refers to whoever is telling the 
story or “speaking.” When you write a letter you are writing in “first person” 
which includes I, me, my, we and our. Second person writing occurs when we talk 
about you and yours and third person includes he, she, they and theirs. In third 
person writing, the author does not interject himself into the story. In writing 
third person (contrary to how you are currently encouraged to write for your 
language arts classes), think about &quot;newspaper articles...they for the most part 
are written in third person.</p>
<p>Third person is hard to write.&nbsp; It sounds so &quot;impersonal and professional&quot;, 
but that is what makes a good abstract.</p>
