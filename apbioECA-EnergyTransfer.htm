<p>Energy Transfer: Cellular Respiration (CR) and Photosynthesis (PS)</p>
<p>1) What evidence provides support that mitochondria and chloroplasts were 
once free living prokaryotes?</p>
<p>2) Which of the above organelles are most likely more ancient? Support your 
answer with evidence with evidence from the geological rock record. (see chapter 
25)</p>
<p>3) Compare (and contrast) the overall chemical formulas for both cellular 
respiration and photosynthesis. Also discuss the similarities and differences 
between the processes in terms of:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) reactants and products, buses (NAD<sup>+</sup>, FAD, 
NADP<sup>+</sup>) is glucose the final product of photosynthesis?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) cycles</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) ATP synthase, chemiosmosis, membranes</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) structural components of the organelles. </p>
<p>4) DNP (2,4-dinitrophenol)
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2,4-Dinitrophenol">
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2,4-Dinitrophenol</a> interfers with ion membrane 
permeability and was used as a diet aid in the 1930's.&nbsp; DNP interacts 
with the inter-membrane by uncoupling the chemiosmotic machinery by making the 
lipid bilayer of the inner mitochondrial membrane leaky to H+; how does this 
contribute to weight loss and why DNP is quite 
dangerous and can lead to death. Who is still using DNP? </p>
<p>5) Why are the following enzymes so important? a) dehydrogenases and b) 
kinases?</p>
<p>6) Which organisms utilize alcohol fermentation? Lactic Acid fermentation? 
Why do organisms bother with these processes?</p>
<p>7) Compare substrate level phosphorylation with oxidative phosphorylation.</p>
<p>8) Why is oxygen so important in CR?</p>
<p>9) Why is phosphofructokinase considered the &quot;pacemaker of respiration&quot;? How 
is CR regulated by feedback mechanisms?(Pg. 181)</p>
<p>10) Compare (and contrast) C3, C4, and CAM photosynthesis. How did 
photorespiration drive natural selection (evolution) of C4 and CAM?</p>
